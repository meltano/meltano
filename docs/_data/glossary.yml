- elt:
  term: ELT
  definition: "ELT means Extract, Load, Transform. It is a method of data replication and transformation used to perform data integration at any scale. The purpose of ELT is to extract specific data, such as customer information or billing records, from its source, and deliver it to its end point in the fastest, most reliable way possible."

- state:
  term: State
  definition: "In Singer extract-load pipelines, the word 'state' is used to refer to progress trackers and artifacts that enable incremental replication. The state for a tap is a JSON object contain the set of bookmarks that track the resume-point for all streams being replicated."

- transformation:
  term: Transformation
  definition: "Data transformation in a modern DataOps platform is a reproducible data shaping process that does not modify source data. Data transformation occurs after EL (extract-load) operations have been executed. Data is shaped or \"transformed\" into more usable datasets, according to the business logic and use cases which are most valuable to the audience."
