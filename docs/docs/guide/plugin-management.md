```

Meltano takes a modular approach to data engineering in general and EL(T) in particular,
where your [project](/concepts/project) and pipelines are composed of [plugins](/concepts/plugins) of [different types](/concepts/plugins#types), most notably **extractors** ([Singer](https://singer.io) taps), **loaders** ([Singer](https://singer.io) targets), and **utilities** (like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com) for transformations, [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)/[Dagster](https://dagster.io/)/etc. for orchestration, and much more on [MeltanoHub](https://hub.meltano.com/utilities/)).

Your project's plugins are defined in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins),
and are [installed](#installing-your-projects-plugins) inside the [`.meltano` directory](/concepts/project#meltano-directory).
They can be managed using various [CLI commands](/reference/command-line-interface).

## Adding a plugin to your project

You can add a new [plugin](/concepts/plugins#project-plugins) to your project using [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add), or
by directly modifying your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins)
and [installing the new plugin](#installing-your-projects-plugins) using [`meltano install`](/reference/command-line-interface#install).

If you'd like to add a [discoverable plugin](/concepts/plugins#discoverable-plugins) that's supported by Meltano out of the box,
like one of the extractors and loaders listed on the [Extractors](https://hub.meltano.com/extractors/) and [Loaders](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/) pages,
refer to the ["Discoverable plugins" section](#discoverable-plugins) below.

Alternatively, if you'd like to add a [custom plugin](/concepts/plugins#custom-plugins) that Meltano isn't familiar with yet,
like an arbitrary Singer tap or target, refer to the ["Custom plugins" section](#custom-plugins).

Finally, if you'd like your new plugin to [inherit from an existing plugin](/concepts/plugins#plugin-inheritance) in your project,
so that it can reuse the same package but override (parts of) its configuration,
refer to the ["Plugin inheritance" section](#plugin-inheritance).

### Discoverable plugins

[Discoverable plugins](/concepts/plugins#discoverable-plugins) can be added to your project by simply providing
[`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add) with their name. Meltano will automatically detect the plugin type:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
# Simplified syntax - plugin type is automatically detected
meltano add <name>

# For example:
meltano add tap-gitlab        # Automatically detected as extractor
meltano add target-postgres   # Automatically detected as loader
meltano add dbt-snowflake     # Automatically detected as utility
meltano add airflow           # Automatically detected as utility

# Explicit plugin type specification for disambiguation when needed
meltano add --plugin-type <type> <name>

# For example:
meltano add --plugin-type extractor tap-gitlab
meltano add --plugin-type loader target-postgres
meltano add --plugin-type utility dbt-snowflake
meltano add --plugin-type utility airflow
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano add <name>

# For example:
meltano add tap-gitlab
meltano add target-postgres
meltano add dbt-snowflake
meltano add airflow
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

This will add a [shadowing plugin definition](/concepts/project#shadowing-plugin-definitions) to your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins) under the `plugins` property, inside an array named after the plugin type:

```yaml title="meltano.yml"
plugins:
  extractors:
  # highlight-start
  - name: tap-gitlab
    variant: meltano
    pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git
  # highlight-end
  loaders:
  # highlight-start
  - name: target-postgres
    variant: datamill-co
    pip_url: singer-target-postgres
  # highlight-end
  utilities:
  # highlight-start
  - name: dbt-snowflake
    variant: dbt-labs
  # highlight-end
  # highlight-start
  - name: airflow
    variant: apache
  # highlight-end
```

If multiple [variants](/concepts/plugins#variants) of the discoverable plugin are available,
the `variant` property is automatically set to the name of the default variant
(which is known to work well and recommended for new users),
so that your project is pinned to a specific package and its [base plugin description](/concepts/plugins#project-plugins).
If the `variant` property were omitted from the definition, Meltano would fall back on the _original_ supported variant instead, which does not necessarily match the default.

The package's `pip_url` (its [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#usage) argument)
is repeated here for convenience, since you may want to update it to
[point at a (custom) fork](#using-a-custom-fork-of-a-plugin) or to [pin a package to a specific version](#pinning-a-plugin-to-a-specific-version).
If this property is omitted, it is inherited from the discoverable [base plugin description](/concepts/plugins#project-plugins) identified by the `name` (and `variant`) instead.

As mentioned above, directly adding a plugin to your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins)
and [installing it](#installing-your-projects-plugins) using [`meltano install [<type>|-] <name>`](/reference/command-line-interface#install)
has the same effect as adding it using [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add).

#### Variants

If multiple [variants](/concepts/plugins#variants) of a discoverable plugin are available,
you can choose a specific (non-default) variant using the `--variant` option on [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add):

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
# With automatic type detection
meltano add <name> --variant <variant>

# For example:
meltano add target-postgres --variant=transferwise  # Type automatically detected as loader

# With explicit type specification for disambiguation
meltano add --plugin-type loader target-postgres --variant=transferwise
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano add loader <name> --variant <variant>

# For example:
meltano add loader target-postgres --variant=transferwise
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

As you might expect, this will be reflected in the `variant` and `pip_url` properties in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins):

```yaml title="meltano.yml"
plugins:
  loaders:
  - name: target-postgres
  # highlight-start
    variant: transferwise
    pip_url: pipelinewise-target-postgres
  # highlight-end
```

If you'd like to use multiple variants of the same discoverable plugin in your project at the same time, refer to ["Multiple variants" under "Explicit inheritance"](#multiple-variants) below.

If you've already added one variant to your project and would like to switch to another, refer to the ["Switching from one variant to another" section](#switching-from-one-variant-to-another) below.

#### Explicit inheritance

In the examples we've considered so far, plugins in your project implicitly inherit their
[base plugin descriptions](/concepts/project#plugins) from discoverable plugins by reusing their names, which is known as [shadowing](/concepts/project#shadowing-plugin-definitions).

Alternatively, if you'd like to give the plugin a more descriptive name in your project,
you can use the `--inherit-from` (or `--as`) option on [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add)
to explicitly inherit from the discoverable plugin instead:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
# With automatic type detection
meltano add <name> --inherit-from <discoverable-name>
# Or equivalently:
meltano add <discoverable-name> --as <name>

# With explicit type specification for disambiguation
meltano add --plugin-type <type> <name> --inherit-from <discoverable-name>
# Or equivalently:
meltano add --plugin-type <type> <discoverable-name> --as <name>

# For example:
meltano add tap-postgres--billing --inherit-from tap-postgres
meltano add tap-postgres --as tap-postgres--billing
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano add <type> <name> --inherit-from <discoverable-name>
# Or equivalently:
meltano add <type> <discoverable-name> --as <name>

# For example:
meltano add extractor tap-postgres--billing --inherit-from tap-postgres
meltano add extractor tap-postgres --as tap-postgres--billing
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The corresponding [inheriting plugin definition](/concepts/project#inheriting-plugin-definitions) in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins) will use `inherit_from`:

```yaml title="meltano.yml"
plugins:
  extractors:
  - name: tap-postgres--billing
    # highlight-next-line
    inherit_from: tap-postgres
    variant: transferwise
    pip_url: pipelinewise-tap-postgres
```

Note that the `variant` and `pip_url` properties were populated automatically by `meltano add` as described above.

##### Multiple variants

If you'd like to use multiple [variants](#variants) of the same discoverable plugin in your project at the same time, this feature will also come in handy.

Since plugins in your project need to have unique names, a discoverable plugin can only be shadowed once,
but it can be inherited from multiple times, with each plugin free to choose its own variant:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
meltano add target-snowflake --variant=transferwise --as target-snowflake--transferwise
meltano add target-snowflake --variant=meltanolabs --as target-snowflake--meltanolabs
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano add loader target-snowflake --variant=transferwise --as target-snowflake--transferwise
meltano add loader target-snowflake --variant=meltanolabs --as target-snowflake--meltanolabs
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Assuming a regular (shadowing) `target-snowflake` was added before using `meltano add loader target-snowflake`,
the resulting [inheriting plugin definitions](/concepts/project#inheriting-plugin-definitions) in [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins) will look as follows:

```yaml title="meltano.yml"
plugins:
  loaders:
  - name: target-snowflake
    variant: datamill-co
    pip_url: target-snowflake
  # highlight-start
  - name: target-snowflake--transferwise
    inherit_from: target-snowflake
    variant: transferwise
  # highlight-end
    pip_url: pipelinewise-target-snowflake
  # highlight-start
  - name: target-snowflake--meltano
    inherit_from: target-snowflake
    variant: meltano
  # highlight-end
    pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/target-snowflake.git
```

Note that the `--variant` option and `variant` property are crucial here:
since `inherit_from` can also be used to [inherit from another plugin in the project](#plugin-inheritance),
`inherit_from: target-snowflake` by itself would have resulted in the new plugin inheriting from the existing `target-snowflake` plugin (that uses the `datamill-co` variant) instead of the discoverable plugin we're looking for.

Had there been no `target-snowflake` plugin in the project yet,
`inherit_from: target-snowflake` would necessarily refer to the discoverable plugin,
but without a `variant` the _original_ variant would have been used rather than the default or a specific chosen one,
just like when shadowing with a `name` but no `variant`.

### Custom plugins

[Custom plugins](/concepts/plugins#custom-plugins) for packages that aren't [discoverable](#discoverable-plugins) yet,
like arbitrary Singer taps and targets,
can be added to your project using the `--custom` option on [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add):

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
meltano add --custom <name>

# For example:
meltano add --custom tap-covid-19
meltano add --custom target-bigquery--custom

# If you're using Docker, don't forget to mount the project directory,
# and ensure that interactive mode is enabled so that Meltano can ask you
# additional questions about the plugin and get your answers over STDIN:
docker run --interactive -v $(pwd):/project -w /project meltano/meltano add --custom tap-covid-19
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano add --custom <type> <name>

# For example:
meltano add --custom extractor tap-covid-19
meltano add --custom loader target-bigquery--custom

# If you're using Docker, don't forget to mount the project directory,
# and ensure that interactive mode is enabled so that Meltano can ask you
# additional questions about the plugin and get your answers over STDIN:
docker run --interactive -v $(pwd):/project -w /project meltano/meltano add --custom extractor tap-covid-19
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Since Meltano doesn't have the [base plugin description](/concepts/plugins#project-plugins) for the package in question yet,
`meltano add --custom` will ask you to find and provide this metadata yourself:
(Note that more context is provided in the actual command prompts.)

```console
$ meltano add --custom extractor tap-covid-19
Adding new custom extractor with name 'tap-covid-19'...

Specify the plugin's namespace, which will serve as the:
- identifier to find related/compatible plugins
- default database schema (`load_schema` extra),
  for use by loaders that support a target schema

Hit Return to accept the default: plugin name with underscores instead of dashes

# highlight-next-line
(namespace) [tap_covid_19]: tap_covid_19

Specify the plugin's `pip install` argument, for example:
- PyPI package name:
  tap-covid-19
- Git repository URL:
  git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-covid-19.git
- local directory, in editable/development mode:
  -e extract/tap-covid-19
- 'n' if using a local executable (nothing to install)

Default: plugin name as PyPI package name

# highlight-next-line
(pip_url) [tap-covid-19]: -e extract/tap-covid-19

Specify the plugin's executable name

Default: name derived from `pip_url`

# highlight-next-line
(executable) [tap-covid-19]: tap-covid-19

Specify the tap's supported Singer features (executable flags), for example:
  `catalog`: supports the `--catalog` flag
  `discover`: supports the `--discover` flag
  `properties`: supports the `--properties` flag
  `state`: supports the `--state` flag

To find out what features a tap supports, reference its documentation or try one
of the tricks under [how to test a tap](/contribute/plugins#how-to-test-a-tap).

Multiple capabilities can be separated using commas.

Default: no capabilities

# highlight-next-line
(capabilities) [[]]: catalog,discover,state

Specify the tap's supported settings (`config.json` keys)

Multiple setting names (keys) can be separated using commas.

A setting kind can be specified alongside the name (key) by using the `:` delimiter,
e.g. `port:integer` to set the kind `integer` for the name `port`

Supported setting kinds:
string | integer | boolean | decimal | date_iso8601 | email | password | oauth | options | file | array | object | hidden

- Credentials and other sensitive setting types should use the password kind.
- If not specified, setting kind defaults to string.
- Nested properties can be represented using the `.` separator, e.g. `auth.username` for `{ "auth": { "username": value } }`.
- To find out what settings a tap supports, reference its documentation.

Default: no settings

# highlight-next-line
(settings) [[]]: api_token:password,user_agent:string,start_date:date_iso8601
Added extractor 'tap-covid-19' to your Meltano project

Installing extractor 'tap-covid-19'...
Installed extractor 'tap-covid-19'
```

If you're adding a Singer tap or target that's listed on Singer's [index of taps](https://www.singer.io/#taps) or [targets](https://www.singer.io/#targets),
simply providing the package name as `pip_url` and `executable` usually suffices.
The plugin's `name` also typically matches the name of the package, but you are free to change it to be more descriptive.

If it's a tap or target you have developed or are developing yourself,
you'll want to set `pip_url` to either a [Git repository URL](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git) or local directory path.
If you add the `-e` flag ahead of the local path, the package will be installed in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs).

To find out what `settings` a tap or target supports, reference the README in the repository and/or documentation. To learn more about the available plugin capabilities, please refer to the [plugin capabilities reference](/reference/plugin-definition-syntax#capabilities). If the `capabilities` a tap supports (executable flags like `--discover` and `--state`) are not described in the available documentation, you can try [one of these tricks](/contribute/plugins#how-to-test-a-tap) or refer directly to the source code.

This will add a [custom plugin definition](/concepts/project#custom-plugin-definitions) to your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins) under the `plugins` property, inside an array named after the plugin type:

```yaml title="meltano.yml"
plugins:
  extractors:
  # highlight-start
  - name: tap-covid-19
    namespace: tap_covid_19
    pip_url: tap-covid-19
    executable: tap-covid-19
    capabilities:
    - catalog
    - discover
    - state
    settings:
    - name: api_token
    - name: user_agent
    - name: start_date
  # highlight-end
```

The `pip_url`, `executable`, `capabilities`, and `settings` properties
constitute the plugin's [base plugin description](/concepts/plugins#project-plugins):
everything Meltano needs to know in order to be able to use the package as a plugin.

:::tip

  <p>Once you've got the plugin working in your project, please consider <a href="/contribute/plugins#discoverable-plugins">adding it to Meltano Hub</a> to make it discoverable and supported out of the box for new users!</p>
:::

### Plugin inheritance

To add a new plugin to your project that [inherits from an existing plugin](/concepts/plugins#plugin-inheritance),
so that it can reuse the same package but override (parts of) its configuration,
you can use the `--inherit-from` option on [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add):

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
meltano add <name> --inherit-from <existing-name>

# For example:
meltano add tap-ga--client-foo --inherit-from tap-google-analytics
meltano add tap-ga--client-bar --inherit-from tap-google-analytics
meltano add tap-ga--client-foo--project-baz --inherit-from tap-ga--client-foo
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano add <type> <name> --inherit-from <existing-name>

# For example:
meltano add extractor tap-ga--client-foo --inherit-from tap-google-analytics
meltano add extractor tap-ga--client-bar --inherit-from tap-google-analytics
meltano add extractor tap-ga--client-foo--project-baz --inherit-from tap-ga--client-foo
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The corresponding [inheriting plugin definitions](/concepts/project#inheriting-plugin-definitions) in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins) will use `inherit_from`:

```yaml title="meltano.yml"
plugins:
  extractors:
  - name: tap-google-analytics
    variant: meltano
    pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-google-analytics.git
  # highlight-start
  - name: tap-ga--client-foo
    inherit_from: tap-google-analytics
  - name: tap-ga--client-bar
    inherit_from: tap-google-analytics
  - name: tap-ga--client-foo--project-baz
    inherit_from: tap-ga--client-foo
  # highlight-end
```

Note that the `--inherit-from` option and `inherit_from` property can also be used to
[explicitly inherit from a discoverable plugin](#explicit-inheritance).

### Updating plugins

You can update a plugin in your project using the `--update` option. Updating a plugin will re-add it to your project - that is:

- Update the plugin lock file (the same as [`meltano lock --update`](/reference/command-line-interface#lock) would)
- Update the plugin entry in the `meltano.yml`, without overwriting any user-defined [config](/concepts/project#plugin-configuration) or [extras](/guide/configuration#plugin-extras)


```bash
meltano add --update <type> <name>

# For example:
meltano add --update extractor tap-gitlab
```

## Installing your project's plugins

Whenever you add a new plugin to a Meltano project using [`meltano add`](/reference/command-line-interface#add),
it will be installed into your project's [`.meltano` directory](/concepts/project#meltano-directory) automatically.

However, since this directory is included in your project's `.gitignore` file
by default, you'll need to explicitly run [`meltano install`](/reference/command-line-interface#install)
before any other `meltano` commands whenever you clone or pull an existing Meltano project from version control,
to install (or update) all plugins specified in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#meltano-yml-project-file).

To install a specific plugin in your project, use [`meltano install <name>`](/reference/command-line-interface#install), e.g. `meltano install tap-gitlab target-postgres`. Meltano will automatically detect the plugin type. Subsequent calls to `meltano install` will upgrade a plugin to its latest version, if any. To completely uninstall and reinstall a plugin, use `--clean`.

:::warning[Deprecated Syntax]

The following syntax forms are deprecated and will be removed in Meltano v4:

| Deprecated Syntax | Use Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `meltano install <plugin_type> <plugin_name>` | `meltano install --plugin-type <plugin_type> <plugin_name>` |
| `meltano install - <plugin_name>` | `meltano install <plugin_name>` |

:::

## Pinning a plugin to a specific version

When you [add a plugin to your project](#adding-a-plugin-to-your-project), the plugin definition's `pip_url` property
(the package's [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#usage) argument)
in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins)
typically points at a [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) package or Git repository without specifying a specific version,
to ensure that you always get the latest and (presumably) greatest.

This makes sense when a plugin is installed for the first time, but can lead to unwelcome surprises down the line,
as your pipeline may break when a new version of the package is released that introduces a bug or changes its behavior in a backward-incompatible or otherwise undesireable way.

To ensure that [`meltano install`](/reference/command-line-interface#install) always installs the same version that was used when you originally got the pipeline working,
you can modify the plugin definition in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins) to include a version identifier in the `pip_url`.

The exact steps to determine the version and modify the `pip_url` will depend on whether you are installing a package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or a Git repository:

### PyPI package

If the plugin's `pip_url` is set to a package name, e.g. `tap-shopify`, [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#usage) will look for a package by that name on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

To pin the latest version:

1. Determine the latest version of the package by browsing to `https://pypi.org/project/<package>`, e.g. https://pypi.org/project/tap-shopify.

   At the time of writing, the latest version of `tap-shopify` is `1.2.6`.

1. Add an `==<version>` or `~=<version>` [version specifier](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers) to the `pip_url`:

   ```yaml
   # Before:
   pip_url: tap-shopify

   # After:
   # highlight-next-line
   pip_url: tap-shopify==1.2.6 # Always install version 1.2.6

   # Alternatively:
   # highlight-next-line
   pip_url: tap-shopify~=1.2.6 # Install 1.2.6 or a newer version in the 1.2.x range
   ```

### Git repository

If the plugin's `pip_url` is set to a `git+http(s)` URL, e.g. `git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git` or `git+https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery.git`, [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#usage) will look for a package in that repository.

To pin the latest version:

1. Determine the latest version of the package by browsing to the `https://` part of the repository URL, e.g. https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab or https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery, and finding the latest Git tag.

   At the time of writing, the [latest tag](https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab/-/tags) of https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab is `v0.9.11`,
   and the [latest tag](https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery/tags) of https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery is`v0.10.2`.

   If no tags are available, you can also use the SHA of the latest commit, e.g.
   [`2657b89e8896face4ce320a03b8413bbc196cec9`](https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab/-/commit/2657b89e8896face4ce320a03b8413bbc196cec9) or

1. Add an `@<tag>` or `@<sha>` [Git ref specifier](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git) to the `pip_url`:

   ```yaml
   # Before:
   pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git
   pip_url: git+https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery.git

   # After:
   # highlight-start
   pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git@v0.9.11
   pip_url: git+https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery.git@v0.10.2
   # highlight-end

   # Alternatively:
   # highlight-start
   pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git@2657b89e8896face4ce320a03b8413bbc196cec9
   pip_url: git+https://github.com/adswerve/target-bigquery.git@3df97b951b7eebdfa331a1ff570f1fe3487d632f
   # highlight-end
   ```

## Installing plugins from a custom Python Package Index (PyPI)

If you need to fetch packages from a custom Python Package Index (PyPI), you can set the `PIP_INDEX_URL` environment variable to your custom URL before running `meltano install`.

:::info
Starting with Meltano 3.4.0, `PIP_*` environment variables can also be set in your project's `.env` file.
:::

In a `Dockerfile`, this would look like:

```dockerfile
ARG PIP_INDEX_URL=<your_custom_pypi_url>
RUN meltano install
```

## Removing a plugin from your project

You can remove a [plugin](/concepts/project#plugins) from your Meltano [project](/concepts/project) by using [`meltano remove`](/reference/command-line-interface#remove). The plugin type is automatically inferred from the plugin name, so you no longer need to specify the type explicitly.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  groupId="meltano-version"
  defaultValue="3.8"
  values={[
    { label: '3.8+', value: '3.8', },
    { label: '3.7 and earlier', value: '3.7', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="3.8">
```

```bash
# Plugin type is automatically inferred
meltano remove <name>
meltano remove <name> <name_two>

# For example:
meltano remove tap-gitlab
meltano remove target-postgres target-csv
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3.7">
```

```bash
meltano remove <type> <name>
meltano remove <type> <name> <name_two>

# For example:
meltano remove extractor tap-gitlab
meltano remove loader target-postgres target-csv
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Since the [`plugins` section](/concepts/project#plugins) of your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project) determines the plugins that make up your project, you can still manually remove a [plugin](/concepts/plugins#project-plugins) from your project by deleting its entry from this file. Traces of the plugin may remain in the other locations mentioned above.

## Using a custom fork of a plugin

If you've forked a plugin's repository and made changes to it, you can update your Meltano project to use your custom fork instead of the canonical source:

1. Modify the plugin definition's `pip_url` in the [`plugins` section](/concepts/project#plugins) of your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project) to point at your fork using a [`git+http(s)` URL](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git), with an optional branch or tag name:

   ```yaml title="meltano.yml"
   plugins:
     extractors:
     - name: tap-gitlab
       variant: meltano
       # highlight-start
       pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git
       # pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git@ref-name
       # highlight-end
   ```

   If your plugin source is stored in a private repository, you have two options:

   - Continue to authenticate over HTTP(S), and store your credentials in a [`.netrc` file](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl/usingcurl-netrc#the-netrc-file-format) in your home directory:

     ```bash
     machine <hostname> # e.g. gitlab.com or github.com
     login <username>
     password <personal-access-token-or-password>
     ```

   - Authenticate using SSH instead, and specify a `git+ssh` URL:

     ```yaml
     pip_url: git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/meltano/tap-gitlab.git
     ```

     Depending on your git provider (such as Azure Repos), some `git+ssh` URLs may contain a colon. This colon can cause errors with `pip`. In this case this can be fixed by replacing the colon with a forward slash.

     For example, instead of this:

     ```
     git+ssh://git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/my_org/
     ```

     Use this:

     ```
     git+ssh://git@ssh.dev.azure.com/v3/my_org/
     ```

1. Reinstall the plugin from the new `pip_url` using [`meltano install`](/reference/command-line-interface#install):

   ```bash
   meltano install [--plugin-type=<type>] <name>

   # For example:
   meltano install tap-gitlab
   ```

If your fork supports additional settings, you can set them as [custom settings](/guide/configuration#custom-settings).

## Switching from one variant to another

The default [variant](/concepts/plugins#variants) of a [discoverable plugin](/concepts/plugins#discoverable-plugins)
is recommended for new users, but may not always be a perfect fit for your use case.

If you've already added one variant to your project and would like to use another instead,
you can [add the new variant as a separate plugin](#multiple-variants) or switch your existing plugin over to the new variant:

1. Modify the plugin definition's `variant` and `pip_url` properties in the [`plugins` section](/concepts/project#plugins) of your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project):

   ```yaml title="meltano.yml"
   # Before:
   plugins:
     loaders:
     - name: target-postgres
       variant: datamill-co
       pip_url: singer-target-postgres

   # After:
   plugins:
     loaders:
     - name: target-postgres
       # highlight-start
       variant: meltano
       pip_url: git+https://github.com/meltano/target-postgres.git # Optional
       # highlight-end
   ```

   If you don't know the new variant's `pip_url` (its [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#usage) argument),
   you can remove this property entirely so that Meltano will fall back on the default.

1. Reinstall the plugin from the new `pip_url` using [`meltano install`](/reference/command-line-interface#install):

   ```bash
   meltano install [--plugin-type=<type>] <name>

   # For example:
   meltano install target-postgres
   ```

1. View the current configuration using [`meltano config <name> list`](/reference/command-line-interface#config) to see if it is still valid:

   ```bash
   meltano config <name> list

   # For example:
   meltano config target-postgres list
   ```

   Because different variants often use different setting names,
   you will likely see some of the settings used by the old variant show up as
   [custom settings](/guide/configuration#custom-settings),
   indicating that they are not supported by the new variant,
   while settings that the new variant expects show up with a `None` or default value.

1. Assuming at least one setting did not carry over correctly from the old variant to the new variant,
   modify the plugin's configuration in your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugin-configuration) to use the new setting names:

   ```yaml
   # Before:
   config:
     postgres_host: postgres.example.com
     postgres_port: 5432
     postgres_username: my_user
     postgres_database: my_database

   # After:
   config:
     # highlight-start
     host: postgres.example.com
     port: 5432
     user: my_user
     dbname: my_database
     # highlight-end
   ```

   If any of the old settings are stored in [places other than `meltano.yml`](/guide/configuration#configuration-layers),
   like a sensitive setting that may be stored in your project's [`.env` file](/concepts/project#env),
   you can unset the old setting and set the new one using [`meltano config`](/reference/command-line-interface#config):

   ```bash
   meltano config <name> unset <old_setting>
   meltano config <name> set <setting> <value>

   # For example:
   meltano config target-postgres unset postgres_password
   meltano config target-postgres set password my_password
   ```

   Keep doing this until `meltano config <name> list` shows a valid configuration for the new variant,
   without any of the old variant's settings remaining as [custom settings](/guide/configuration#custom-settings).
