This document will get you up and running with Meltano in-depth. There is also a [short install guide for first-time Meltano users](/getting-started/installation).

:::

## Local Installation

In the section below, we will install Meltano locally on your system, so that you can use it [on the command line](/reference/command-line-interface).

:::caution

  <p>Please note that Windows is not fully supported yet so some features like the ELT command may not work yet.
  See the GitHub [Windows Label](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/labels/Windows) for more information.</p>

  <br/>

  <p>If you'd like all of Meltano's features to work, you can install Meltano inside the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
  You may also try [installing Meltano on Docker](#installing-on-docker).</p>
:::

### Requirements

Before you install Meltano, make sure you have the following requirements installed and up to date.

#### Python

:::info

  <p>You may refer to <a href="https://realpython.com/installing-python/">https://realpython.com/installing-python/</a> for platform specific installation instructions.</p>
:::

Use the following command to check that you have a supported Python version installed:

```shell
python --version
```

Currently Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 are supported. Note that not all plugins support these versions, so you might need to specify [a different version for the plugin](/reference/settings/#python).

#### Install pipx

`pip` is a package installer that comes automatically with Python 3+.
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is a wrapper around `pip` which cleanly installs executable python tools (such as Meltano) into their own virtual environments.

<Tabs className="meltano-tabs">
  <TabItem className="meltano-tab-content" value="unix" label="Unix" default>

  ```bash
  # install pipx and ensure it is on the path
  python3 -m pip install --user pipx
  python3 -m pipx ensurepath
  # Be sure pipx is available on your path
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem className="meltano-tab-content" value="windows" label="Windows">

  ```powershell
  # install pipx and ensure it is on the path
  python3 -m pip install --user pipx
  python3 -m pipx ensurepath
  # Be sure pipx is available on your path
  RefreshEnv
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

  <p>Why use pipx and virtual environments?</p>
  <p>Your local environment may use a different version of Python or other dependencies that are
difficult to manage. The pipx installer automatically creates a virtual environment and provides a
"clean" isolated space without version conflicts or other compatibility issues.</p>
:::

### Install Meltano

Now that you have [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) installed, run the following command to install the Meltano package into its
own pipx-backed virtual environment:

```bash
pipx install meltano
```

Once the installation completes, you can check if it was successful by running:

```bash
meltano --version
```

### Install Git

Many Meltano plugins require Git to be installed on your system. You can check if Git is installed by running:

```shell
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, you can download and install it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Optional Components

Some components of Meltano are optional and not installed by default. See the guide on [installing optional components](/guide/advanced-topics#installing-optional-components) for more information.

### Next Steps

Now that you've installed Meltano and its requirements, you can continue setting up your Meltano project by following the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started#create-your-meltano-project).

## uv

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) is a Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It makes it easy to install a Python-based tool like Meltano in an isolated virtual environment.

Once you have `uv` installed, you can install Meltano by running the following command:

```shell
uv tool install meltano
```

### Specifying a Python Version

To install Meltano with a specific version of Python, you can use the `--python` flag. For example, to install Meltano with Python 3.13:

```shell
uv tool install --python 3.13 meltano
```

This will download the requested version of Python (if not already installed) and install Meltano in a virtual environment using that version.

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an alternative installation option to [using a virtual environment to run Meltano](#virtual-environment). To use these instructions you will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) onto your computer and have it running when you execute the commands below.

### Using Pre-built Docker Images

We maintain the [`meltano/meltano`](https://hub.docker.com/r/meltano/meltano) Docker image on Docker Hub, which comes with Python and Meltano pre-installed.

To get the latest version of Meltano, pull the `latest` tag. Images for specific versions of Meltano are tagged `v<X.Y.Z>`, e.g. `v3.5.4`.

By default, these images come with a version of Python chosen for a balance of stability and compatibility, currently Python 3.10.
If you'd like to use a different version of Python instead, add a `-python<X.Y>` suffix to the image tag, e.g. `latest-python3.11` and `v3.5.4-python3.11`.

```bash
# download or update to the latest version
docker pull meltano/meltano

# Or choose a specific version of Meltano and/or Python:
# docker pull meltano/meltano:v3.5.4
# docker pull meltano/meltano:latest-python3.11
# docker pull meltano/meltano:v3.5.4-python3.12

# check the currently installed version
docker run meltano/meltano --version
```

### Initialize Your Project

Once you have Docker installed, running, and have pulled the pre-built image you can use Meltano just as you would in our [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started). However, the command line syntax is slightly different. For example, let's create a new Meltano project:

```bash
cd /your/projects/directory

docker run -v "$(pwd)":/projects \
             -w /projects \
             meltano/meltano init yourprojectname
```

Then you can `cd` into your new project:

```bash
cd yourprojectname
```

Now that you're successfully running Meltano, you can continue setting up your Meltano project by following the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started).

Note that wherever you are asked to run the `meltano` command, you will want to run it through `docker run` as in the snippet above.

## Upgrading Meltano Version

We release new versions of Meltano every week. To keep tabs on the latest releases, follow along on the [Meltano blog](https://meltano.com/blog/), or have a look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Using the command line

You can update Meltano to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal from inside a Meltano project:

```
meltano upgrade
```
