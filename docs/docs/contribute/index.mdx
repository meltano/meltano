## Where do I start?

If you'd like to contribute, but you're not sure _what_, check out the list of open issues labeled [Accepting Pull Requests](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/labels/accepting%20pull%20requests). Any other improvements are welcome too, of course, so simply asking yourself "What could have been better while I was using Meltano?" is another good way to come up with ideas.

If an issue for your problem or suggested improvement doesn't exist yet on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/issues),
please [file a new one](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/issues/new) before submitting a [pull request](/contribute/merge),
so that the team and community are aware of your plan and can help you figure out the best way to realize it.
