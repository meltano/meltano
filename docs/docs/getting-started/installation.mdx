Before you can use Meltano, youâ€™ll need to get it installed. We have a [complete installation guide](/guide/installation-guide) that covers all the possibilities, virtual environments and using pipx; this guide will guide you to a fast installation that will work for the tutorial.

## Install Meltano

Use the following command to check that you have a supported Python version installed:

```bash
python --version
```

Meltano supports all versions of Python that have not yet reached their end-of-life date. Refer to [the official Python documentation for when versions of Python will reach end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

:::caution

Not all plugins support the latest versions of Python.

  <TabItem className="meltano-tab-content" value="uv" label="Using uv" default>

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) is a Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It makes it easy to install a Python-based tool like Meltano in an isolated virtual environment.

<br />

<Termy>

```console
$ uv tool install meltano
---> 100%
Installed 1 executable: meltano
```

</Termy>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem className="meltano-tab-content" value="pipx" label="Using pipx" default>

Since Meltano is an application, it should always be installed into a clean virtual environment without any other packages installed alongside it.

To simplify installing Meltano into a clean virtual environment, [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) can be used to install Meltano instead of `pip`. `pip` is a package installer that comes automatically with Python. `pipx` is a wrapper around pip which cleanly installs executable Python applications (such as Meltano) into their own virtual environments.

<br/>

<Termy>

```console
$ pipx install "meltano"
---> 100%
successfully installed meltano
```

</Termy>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem className="meltano-tab-content" value="docker" label="Using Docker">

We maintain [the `meltano/meltano` Docker image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/meltano/meltano/tags), which comes with Python and Meltano pre-installed.

To get the latest version of Meltano, pull the latest tag. Images for specific versions of Meltano are tagged `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, e.g. `v2.19.0`. Add a `-python3.X` suffix to the image tag to change the python version, e.g. `latest-python3.9`. To get the latest minor or patch version, omit that value from the version number, e.g. `v2` for the latest Meltano `v2.*.*` image, or `v2.19` for the latest Meltano `v2.19.*` image

<br/>

<Termy>

```console
$ docker pull meltano/meltano
latest: Pulling from meltano/meltano
---> 100%
Status: Downloaded newer image for meltano/meltano:latest
docker.io/meltano/meltano:latest

$ docker run meltano/meltano --version
meltano, version 2.19.0

```

</Termy>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem className="meltano-tab-content" value="pip" label="Using pip">

Meltano provides a Python package that can be installed using `pip`.

:::caution

  <p>To avoid dependency conflicts, please ensure Meltano is installed into a clean Python virtual environment.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    You can use the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip/#cmdoption-require-virtualenv"><code>--require-virtualenv</code></a> command
    line flag or the <code>PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=1</code> environment variable to ensure that Meltano is installed into a virtual environment.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    In ephemeral CI or container-based deployments where Meltano is the main application, installing it globally may actually
    be preferred.
  </p>

<Termy>

```console
$ pip install --upgrade pip
Requirement already satisfied.
$ pip install "meltano"
---> 100%
successfully installed meltano
```
