import Termy from '@site/src/utils/Termy'

Let’s learn by example.

In parts [1](/getting-started/part1) & [2](/getting-started/part2), we extracted data from GitHub and loaded it into a (local) PostgreSQL database. Now it is time to have more fun. We decide to load all attributes from the data we selected previously, and then build a model listing the different authors of commits to our repository.

That means, in this part we're going to unleash dbt [(data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/) onto our data to transform it into meaningful information.
Don't worry, you don't need to know anything about dbt, this tutorial is self-contained. You do not need to install dbt yourself, it works as a Meltano plugin.

Of course you can choose any other processing tool like:
- a jupyter notebook
- or plain Python

to process your data.

:::

## Select more source data

To get all the data from the GitHub commits, you can use the `meltano select` command:

```bash
meltano select tap-github commits "*"
```

This will add the following line to your project file:

```yaml
      extractors:
      - name: tap-github
        [...]
        select:
        - commits.url # <== technically not necessary anymore, but no need to delete
        - commits.sha # <== technically not necessary anymore, but no need to delete
        - commits.commit_timestamp # <== technically not necessary anymore, but no need to delete
        - commits.* # <== new data.
```

To refresh your database tables after the configuration changes you can run `meltano run --full-refresh tap-github target-postgres`:

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano run --full-refresh tap-github target-postgres
2024-09-22T07:36:52.985090Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
{"type": "STATE", "value":  [...]}

...[many more records]...

```

</Termy>

Next, we add the dbt plugin to transform this data.

## Install and configure the Postgres-specific dbt utility

dbt uses different [adapters](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms) depending on the database/warehouse/platform you use. Meltano dbt utilities match this pattern; in this case our utility is `dbt-postgres`. As usual, you can use the `meltano add` command to add it to your project.

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano add utility dbt-postgres
2024-09-22T11:32:35.601357Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
Added utility 'dbt-postgres' to your Meltano project
...
2024-01-01T00:25:40.604941Z [info     ] Installing utility 'dbt-postgres'
---> 100%
...
Installed utility 'dbt-postgres'
2024-01-01T00:25:53.152127Z [info     ] Installed utility 'dbt-postgres'
2024-01-01T00:25:53.152894Z [info     ] Installed 1/1 plugins
```

</Termy>

## Initialize dbt

Next you can run the `initialize` command to have the transformer utility populate the project scaffold for dbt.

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano invoke dbt-postgres:initialize
2024-09-22T07:36:52.985090Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
creating dbt profiles directory path=PosixPath('/[...]/my-meltano-project/transform/profiles/postgres')
dbt initialized                dbt_ext_type=postgres dbt_profiles_dir=PosixPath('/[...]/my-meltano-project/transform/profiles/postgres') dbt_project_dir=PosixPath('/[...]/my-meltano-project/transform')
```

</Termy>

<br />

:::tip
<p>Installing dbt-postgres may <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-postgres/issues/96">require building <code>psycopg2</code> from source</a>. An easy workaround is to constrain <code>dbt-postgres</code> in the plugin's <code>pip_url</code> in your <code>meltano.yml</code> file:</p>

```yaml
  utilities:
  - name: dbt-postgres
    pip_url: dbt-core dbt-postgres<1.8 meltano-dbt-ext~=0.3.0
```
:::

You can verify that this worked by viewing that the `transform` directory is newly populated with dbt configuration files.

## Configure dbt

Configure the dbt-postgres utility to use the same configuration as our target-postgres loader using `meltano config`:

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set host localhost
&ensp;&ensp;Utility 'dbt-postgres' setting 'host' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'localhost'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set port 5432
&ensp;&ensp;Utility 'dbt-postgres' setting 'port' was set in `meltano.yml`: 5432
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set user meltano
&ensp;&ensp;Utility 'dbt-postgres' setting 'user' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'meltano'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set password password
&ensp;&ensp;Utility 'dbt-postgres' setting 'password' was set in `.env`: (redacted)
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set dbname postgres
&ensp;&ensp;Utility 'dbt-postgres' setting 'dbname' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'postgres'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set schema analytics
&ensp;&ensp;Utility 'dbt-postgres' setting 'schema' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'analytics'
```

</Termy>

<br />
The result of your configuration will look like this in your meltano.yml, remember that sensitive configurations are in your .env file:

```yaml
  utilities:
  - name: dbt-postgres
    [...]
    config:
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      user: meltano
      dbname: postgres
      schema: analytics
```

## Add our source data to dbt

The EL pipeline run already added our source data into the schema `tap_github` as table `commits`. dbt will need to know where to locate this data. Let's add that to our dbt project:

```bash
mkdir transform/models/tap_github
```

Add a file called `transform/models/tap_github/source.yml` into this directory with the following content:

```yaml
config-version: 2
version: 2
sources:
  - name: tap_github     # the name we want to reference this source by
    schema: tap_github   # the schema the raw data was loaded into
    tables:
      - name: commits
```

Now we're able to reference the table using the keyword "source" as you can see next.

## Add a transformed model

Add a file called `authors.sql` to the folder `transform/models/tap_github` with the following contents:

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='table'
  )
}}

with base as (
    select *
    from {{ source('tap_github', 'commits') }}
)
select distinct (commit -> 'author' -> 'name') as authors
from base

```

This model is configured to creating a table via the `materialized='table'` configuration. The keyword `source` is used in dbt to reference the source we just created. The actual model selects the distinct author names from the commits which are wrapped into a JSON blob.

## Run the transformation process

To create the actual table, we run the dbt model via `meltano invoke dbt-postgres:run`. Note this relies on previously running `meltano run --full-refresh tap-github target-postgres` to postgres your database `commits` table:

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano invoke dbt-postgres:run
2024-09-22T12:30:31.842691Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active

20:45:15
20:45:15  Done. PASS=1 WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
#
```
</Termy>

<br />

:::tip
<p>If you encounter an error related to dbt not being to clean files outside of the project directory, you can add the following to your <code>meltano.yml</code> file:</p>

```yaml
version: 1
env:
  DBT_CLEAN_PROJECT_FILES_ONLY: "false"
```
:::

You can check the data inside the database using your favourite SQL editor. There should now be a table inside the `analytics` schema called `authors` populated with data.

## Run the complete pipeline

To check that everything works together as a pipeline, we clean out once more and run the whole pipeline. Drop the tap_github.commits and the analytics.authors tables by running

```bash
docker exec meltano_postgres psql -d postgres -U meltano -c 'DROP TABLE tap_github.commits; DROP TABLE analytics.authors;'
```

Run the final pipeline alltogether using the parameter `--full-refresh` to ignore the stored state:

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano run --full-refresh tap-github target-postgres dbt-postgres:run
[warning  ] Performing full refresh, ignoring state left behind by any previous runs.
