# Community

We aim to build Meltano with the support of the community and we want everyone to feel included.

## Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in dbt Slack, codebase, issue trackers, and mailing lists are expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct][conduct]. If you are unable to abide by the code of conduct set forth here, we encourage you not to participate in the community.

### Contributor Guide

We welcome contributions to the project! Please review our [Contributor Guide](/docs/contributor-guide.html) on how to contribute.

## Demo Days

We have Demo Days every other week on Friday at 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC). Join us on Zoom to share and hear updates from community members and the Meltano team about how they've been using Meltano. We also have the #demo-day Slack channel for planning and discussion.

Our next demo days are:

* 2021-06-04
* 2021-06-18
* 2021-07-02
* 2021-07-16
* 2021-07-30

Use [this link][gcal] to view the full events calendar. View past office hours in our [YouTube Playlist][demodayplaylist].

### Guidelines

We aim to have Demo Day primarily as a way to have community members showcase the work they've been doing, whether it's related to Meltano or not.
As such, we will limit the number of vendors presenting to a maximum of 1 per Demo Day.

We will prioritize vendors that don't have a strong overlap with the core capabilities of Meltano.
Ideally, a vendor would be able to share how their product could be compatible with Meltano or with one of the open source plugins detailed in the MeltanoHub.

## Office Hours

We have Office Hours weekly on **Wednesdays at 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC)**. Join us on Zoom and bring any questions you have to the team. There is often a short presentation of recent and upcoming updates from the core team, but otherwise this is your time to chat with us and get help on any topics you would like.

Use [this link][gcal] to view the events calendar or check the [`#office-hours` channel](https://meltano.slack.com/archives/C01QS0RV78D) in the <SlackChannelLink>Meltano Slack workspace<OutboundLink /></SlackChannelLink> for weekly discussion topics and agenda updates. Prior to each weekly session, we share the Zoom link in Slack and the YouTube live stream link via social media (Twitter).

### Channels

This is for posts from the Core Team to the wider community. Here we will share exciting news, upcoming events, new releases, and other relevant information.

##### @Channel usage

We will use `@channel` no more than three times per week and aim to use it a maximum of once per day.

#### Channel Bookmarks

We use Slack's [channel bookmarks](https://slack.com/blog/productivity/whats-new-in-slack-simplified-search-channel-bookmarks) feature to add relevant links for a specific channel.

Our general guidance for bookmarks are:

* Approximately 3 links max for a channel. Don't clutter and make the links feel noisy
* Relevant to the channel topic i.e. linking to MeltanoHub for #hub and to Meltano SDK for #sdk
* Regularly review the link if it's to the "latest" version of something i.e. blog post, release, etc.
