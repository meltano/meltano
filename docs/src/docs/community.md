# Community

We aim to build Meltano with the support of the community and we want everyone to feel included.

## Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in dbt Slack, codebase, issue trackers, and mailing lists are expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct][conduct]. If you are unable to abide by the code of conduct set forth here, we encourage you not to participate in the community.

### Contributor Guide

We welcome contributions to the project! Please review our [Contributor Guide](/docs/contributor-guide.html) on how to contribute.

## Demo Days

We have Demo Days every other week on Friday at 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC). Join us on Zoom to share and hear updates from community members and the Meltano team about how they've been using Meltano. We also have the #demo-day Slack channel for planning and discussion.

Our next demo days are:

## Office Hours

We have Office Hours weekly on Wednesday at 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC). Join us on Zoom and bring any questions you have to the team. We will share the Zoom link in Slack and via social media prior to the event. There is sometimes a short presentation about something top of mind from the core team, but otherwise this is your time to chat with us and get some help. Use [this link][gcal] to view the events calendar. We also have the #office-hours Slack channel for planning and discussion.

### Channels

We have a number of channels which we use on a regular basis to communicate and share information with the community. 

#### #announcements

This is for posts from the Core Team to the wider community. Here we will share exciting news, upcoming events, new releases, and other relevant information.

##### @Channel usage

We will use `@channel` no more than three times per week and aim to use it a maximum of once per day.
