# Community

We aim to build Meltano with the support of the community and we want everyone to feel included.

## Guidelines

Everyone interacting in dbt Slack, codebase, issue trackers, and mailing lists are expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct][conduct]. If you are unable to abide by the code of conduct set forth here, we encourage you not to participate in the community.

## Demo Days

We have Demo Days every other week on Friday at 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC). Join us on Zoom to share and hear updates from community members and the Meltano team about how they've been using Meltano.

Our next demo days are:

* 2021-03-26
* 2021-04-02
* 2021-04-16
* 2021-04-30

## Office Hours

We have Office Hours weekly on Wednesday at 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC). Join us on Zoom and bring any questions you have to the team. There is sometimes a short presentation about something top of mind from the core team, but otherwise this is your time to chat with us and get some help.
