Meltano stands for the steps of the data life cycle:

- Model
- Extract
- Load
- Transform
- Analyze
- Notebook
- Orchestrate

To empower you and your team in this life cycle, Meltano manifests as two tools:

1. command line interface (CLI)
1. web app (GUI)

These two tools enable you and your team to use Meltano in a few different ways:

1. Meltano as a **Project** (CLI + GUI)
    - From data extraction to analysis and visualization with orchestration for automating the process
1. Meltano as a **Framework** (CLI)
    - Helps you create and test extractors, loaders, and transformers
1. Meltano as an **ELT** only (CLI)
    - Runtime for extracting, loading, and transforming data
1. Meltano as a **UI** only (GUI)
    - Interactively query, explore, and visualize data using various charts, reports, and dashboards
