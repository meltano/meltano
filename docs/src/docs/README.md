# Introduction

[Meltano](https://meltano.com) is ELT for the DataOps era:
[open source](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano),
[self-hosted](/docs/production.html),
[CLI-first](/docs/command-line-interface.html),
[debuggable](/docs/command-line-interface.html#debugging), and
[extensible](/docs/plugins.html).

This page covers the project's [Mission](#mission), [Focus](#focus), [Roadmap](#roadmap), and [History](#history).

## Mission

Our mission is to enable every organization to make the 
best decisions possible by becoming data-informed.

To achieve this mission we are building an **open source platform for the complete DataOps lifecycle** 
that is optimized for the happiness and productivity of Data Teams and Data Professionals.
It integrates best-in-class [open source components](/docs/plugins.html) and
enables teams to collaborate on data projects and pipelines more efficiently and with higher confidence.

Our focus has been on bringing these qualities to the first step in any data journey:
integration and transformation, aka EL(T): [Extract, Load, Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_load,_transform),
where traditional solutions are either off-the-shelf and near-impossible to extend, tweak, and debug,
or fully custom and a pain to maintain.

We believe that [data integration is ripe for commoditization](/blog/2020/05/13/why-we-are-building-an-open-source-platform-for-elt-pipelines/),
and are building towards a future in which fast and reliable **open source connectors
for every data source and destination** in the world will be freely available,
collectively maintained by a community of data engineers in consulting and at in-house data teams,
and by API vendors themselves, just like we see with API client libraries today.

### Embracing Singer

To make this a reality, we have embraced [Singer](https://www.singer.io/)
and are committed to providing its community and ecosystem with all of the tools and support
needed for it to realize its full potential as the **de-facto standard for open source connectors**,
to be used with Meltano or any other tool that supports them.

To further support the community and ecosystem, we have [created an interpretation of the Singer specification](/docs/singer-spec.html)
that aims to be clearer for newcomers to the project. We believe the spec is great in its current version, but 
confusing documentation has made it challenging for some to onboard to the community.

With Meltano, we are providing a **clear path to production** with existing Singer taps and targets where there wasn't one before,
thereby lowering the barrier to adoption and motivating people who run into an issue with an existing connector
to debug it, contribute a fix, and see it through, instead of giving up.

The upcoming [**Singer SDK**](https://gitlab.com/meltano/singer-sdk) will enable developers to build **connectors with all the bells and whistles** without having to be become an expert on the spec.
This further lowers the barrier to creating new connectors and contributing to existing ones,
and will lead to increased reliability and consistency.

We are also [planning to grow](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/epics/83)
Meltano's index of [discoverable extractors and loaders](/docs/plugin-structure.html#discoverable-plugins)
into the Singer equivalent of [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/),
to give users (and tools) a **central place to learn** about the behavior, supported features,
and maintenance status of **all taps and targets in the ecosystem**,
which are currently scattered across Git repos and PyPI packages.
We will encourage decentralized maintenance of connectors
to prevent individual organizations from becoming bottlenecks as the ecosystem grows,
and will support the adoption of abandoned connectors by new maintainers.

Last but not least, we intend to **[**unlock the evolution**](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/epics/88) of the
[**Singer spec**](/docs/singer-spec.html)** through
a framework for the proposal and consideration of optional extensions to the spec
that compatible tools, including the SDK and Meltano, can choose to support,
while maintaining compatibility between all taps and targets.

## Focus

As described above, our vision for ELT in the DataOps era involves
a decentralized ecosystem of open source connectors and
a community of data engineers maintaining and contributing to these projects.

To make this happen, we are primarily focused on users and teams
that have the potential and the necessary technical skills to become
**active participants in this community**,
rather than those who prefer a hands-off approach with off-the-shelf connectors maintained by a single (paid) provider.

In order of priority, our target personas are:

1. **Data consultants** who may become [implementation partners](/partners/)
   - They frequently write one-off (Python) scripts to extract data from niche sources that aren't supported by commercial EL(T) vendors.
   - They want to stop reinventing the wheel and standardize their approach to building reliable and reusable custom connectors.
   - They are willing to open source their custom connectors to share the maintenance burden with the community and,
      in return, get access to connectors built and maintained by other consulting firms and data engineers.
   - They want a consistent approach to extracting data from common sources (that are supported by commercial vendors) and niche ones (that aren't).
   - They want the ability to customize and fix bugs in connectors without having to wait on a vendor.
   - They want to save their clients money by self-hosting pipelines instead of being beholden to vendor pricing.
   - They want to give their clients the option of never having their sensitive data pass through systems out of their control for privacy or compliance reasons.
   - They want to manage their data projects like any other software engineering project, with all of the benefits of version control and CI/CD.
   - They want to offer clients a (whitelabel) web UI to set up their connections and manage their pipelines.
2. **Data engineers** with a software development background
   - They are comfortable using a CLI and want to manage their data project like any other software engineering project, with all of the benefits of version control and CI/CD.
   - They recognize that connectors are like API client libraries, and are comfortable using open source options even if they may require some tweaking and contributing fixes upstream.
   - They want a consistent approach to extracting data from common sources (that are supported by commercial vendors) and niche ones (that aren't).
   - They want the ability to customize and fix bugs in connectors without having to wait on a vendor.
   - They may not want their sensitive data to pass through systems out of their control for privacy or compliance reasons.
   - They may want to extract data from region-specific sources and SaaS tools that are not supported by the US-centric commercial vendors.
   - They may have more development time to spend than money and would rather build and contribute to connectors than pay an expensive vendor.
3. Developers of **data products**
   - They want to let their users connect sources directly to their product.
   - They want to be able to configure and run pipelines programmatically.
   - They want to leverage existing connectors so they can focus on what their product does with the data instead of getting access to it.
   - They want to open source any custom connectors they write to share the maintenance burden with the community.

## Roadmap

Meltano is developed completely in the open on GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano>. Our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues), [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/epics), and [weekly milestones](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones) can be found there as well.

To get an idea of what the team and community are currently working on, check out the upcoming milestone's [Development Flow board](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/boards/536761?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&milestone_title=%23upcoming).

If you'd like to look further into the future, the [Milestones board](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/boards/1933232) has a column for each upcoming weekly milestone.

Be aware that issue milestones serve more as a rough indication of relative priority than as hard deadlines,
since short-term priorities can change quickly in response to community feedback, and it's hard to predict how much progress can be made in a week.
Also note that issues labeled `flow::To Do` have higher priority and are more likely to be completed in a given week than those labeled `flow::Triage`, which are often moved to the next milestone at the end of the week, with issues already scheduled for the next week pushed out to make room for them.

Below you will found our current roadmap. As this projects out into the future it is subject to change based on feedback. Don't see something you want on the roadmap? [Make an issue](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues) and let us know!

## History

Meltano, originally called BizOps, was founded inside [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) [in 2018](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/01/hey-data-teams-we-are-working-on-a-tool-just-for-you/) to serve the GitLab Data Team. It is maintained primarily by [the Meltano team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/meltano/) at GitLab, which continues to sponsor its development.
