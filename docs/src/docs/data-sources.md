# Data Sources

The following data sources are fully supported by Meltano UI, from setting up your connection to creating reports and sharing dashboards:

* [Facebook Ads](/plugins/extractors/facebook.html)
* [Google Ads](/plugins/extractors/adwords.html)
* [Google Analytics](/plugins/extractors/google-analytics.html)
* [Salesforce](/plugins/extractors/salesforce.html)
* [Shopify](/plugins/extractors/shopify.html)
* [Stripe](/plugins/extractors/stripe.html)

When using the [CLI](/developer-tools/command-line-interface.html), [additional data sources](/plugins/extractors/) are supported, as is [creating your own custom extractors](/tutorials/create-a-custom-extractor.html) to pull in data from arbitrary data sources.
