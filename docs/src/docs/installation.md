# Installation

In this section, we will install Meltano as an application you can access from your browser and command line. If you prefer to install to Docker, please view the installation instructions [here](/docs/installation.html#installing-on-docker).

::: warning
We do not have a double click installer at this time, but it is in our roadmap and we will be sure to update this page when we do!
:::

## Requirements

Before you install meltano with `pip install meltano` make sure you have the following requirements installed and up to date.

### Python 3+

- [Python 3.6.1+](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

::: tip
You may refer to [https://realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for platform specific installation instructions.
:::

To check if you have the correct Python version, open your terminal and use the following commands to check the version:

```bash
python --version
```

### pip

`pip` is a package installer that comes automatically with Python 3+. This is also what we will be using to install Meltano. Here are some commands related to `pip` that may be of interest:

```bash
# Check for current version of pip
pip --version

# Update pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```

::: tip
If `pip`/`python` is not working, try `pip3`/`python3` instead. This would be the case if you have both Python 2+ _and_ 3+ installed.
:::

### Virtual Environment

::: danger IMPORTANT
Unless you are building a Docker image, It is **strongly recommended** that Meltano be installed inside a virtual environment in order to avoid potential system conflicts that may be difficult to debug.

**Why use a virtual environment?**

Your local environment may use a different version of Python or other dependencies that are difficult to manage. The virtual environment provides a "clean" space to work without these issues.
:::

#### Recommened Virtual Environment Setup

We suggest you create a directory where you want your virtual environments to be saved, e.g.:

- **Linux, OSX**: `~/virtualenvs`
- **Windows**: `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\virtualenvs`

Then create a new virtual environment inside that directory:

```bash
# Linux, OSX
mkdir ~/virtualenvs
python -m venv ~/virtualenvs/meltano

# Windows
mkdir %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\virtualenvs
python -m venv %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\virtualenvs\\meltano
```

#### Activating Your Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using:

```bash
# Linux, OSX
source ~/virtualenvs/meltano/bin/activate

# Windows
%HOME%\\virtualenvs\\meltano\\Scripts\\activate.bat
```

## Installing Meltano

Now that you have your virtual environment set up and running, navigate to the directory where you want to install Meltano and run the following command:

```bash
pip install meltano
```

Once the installation completes, you can check if it was successful by running:

```bash
meltano --version
```

That's it! Meltano is now be available for you to use. Now we can [create a Meltano project](/docs/quickstart.html).

::: tip
Once a virtual environment is activated, it stays active until the current shell is closed.

You must re-activate the virtual environment before interacting with Meltano.
To streamline this process, you can add the `meltano` executable directly in your `PATH`.

```bash
# Linux, OSX
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/virtualenvs/meltano/bin/meltano

# Windows
setx PATH "%PATH%;%ALLUSERPROFILES\virtualenvs\meltano\Scripts\meltano"
```

:::

### Installing on Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an alternative installation option to [using a virtual environment to run Meltano](http://localhost:8080/docs/installation.html#virtual-environment). To use these instructions you will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) onto your computer and have it running when you execute the commands below.

#### Using Pre-built Docker Images

We provide the [meltano/meltano](https://hub.docker.com/r/meltano/meltano) docker image with Meltano pre-installed and ready to use.

> Note: The **meltano/meltano** docker image is also available in GitLab's registry: `registry.gitlab.com`

This image contains everything you need to get started with Meltano.

```bash
# download or update to the latest version
docker pull meltano/meltano

# look the currently installed version
docker run meltano/meltano --version
```

#### Initialize Your Project

Once you have Docker installed, running, and have pulled the pre-built image you can use Meltano just as you would in our Quickstart Guide. However, the command line syntax is slightly different. For example, let's create a new Meltano project:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/projects \
             -w /projects \
             meltano/meltano init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

Then you can `cd` into your new project:

```
cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

We can then start the Meltano UI. Since `ui` is the default command, we can omit it.

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             -p 5000:5000 \
             meltano/meltano
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the Meltano UI.

If you are a Meltano end-user who is not going to be contributing code to our open source repository, you should be able to use Meltano entirely from the UI at this point.

Follow the steps in our [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.html) to get started.

#### For Contributors: Example Command Line Syntax for Docker

Here are some example of CLI commands you may need to run if you are working with Meltano as an open source contributor:

##### Running the ELT from the Command Line

To run the ELT and extract some data from the **tap-carbon-intensity** into **target-sqlite**:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             meltano/meltano elt tap-carbon-intensity target-sqlite
```

##### Adding a Model from the Command Line

Now that we have data in your database, let's add the corresponding model bundle as the basis of our analysis.

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             meltano/meltano add model model-carbon-intensity-sqlite
```

## Upgrading Version

We release new versions of Meltano weekly. To update Meltano to the latest version, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install --upgrade meltano
```

Follow along on the [Meltano blog](https://meltano.com/blog/) to keep tabs on the latest releases, or visit our [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Deployment

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

::: warning Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you have a functioning Docker image where your Meltano project is already bundled with the Meltano installation. To track this issue, follow [meltano#624](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/issues/624).
:::

In this section, we will be going over how you can deploy a Meltano Docker image to AWS.

#### Setting Up Elastic Container Service (ECS)

1. Login to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
1. Search for [ECS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs) and click on the link

![](/screenshots/aws-ecs.png)

![](/screenshots/aws-ecs-getting-started.png)

1. We will create a new _Container definition_ by clicking on the `Configure` button in the **custom** card
1. Fill out the form with the following data:

- **Container name**: Meltano
- **Image**: YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_URL
  - Examples:
    - docker.io/namespace/image-name:tag
    - registry.gitlab.com/namespace/project/image-name:tag
- **Memory Limits (MiB)**: Soft limit 1024
- **Port mappings**:
  - 5000/tcp (meltano)
  - 5010/tcp (airflow)

1. Click `Update` button to finish setting up your container defintion
1. Click `Edit` next to the _Task defintion_ heading
1. Update the form with the following:

- **Task definition name**: meltano-run
- **Network mode**: awsvpc
- **Task execution role**: ecsTaskExecutionRole
- **Compatibilities**: FARGATE
- **Task memory**: 1GB (1024)
- **Task CPU**: 0.25 vCPU (256)

1. Click `Next` to move to the next step

#### Review service properties

![](/screenshots/aws-ecs-review-service.png)

1. Verify that the properties are as follows:

- **Service name**: meltano-service
- **Number of desired tasks**: 1
- **Security group**: Automatically create new
- **Load balancer type**: None

1. Click `Next` to move on to the next step

#### Configure your cluster

The main configuration here is the **Cluster name**. We provide a suggestion below, but feel free to name it as you wish.

- **Cluster name**: meltano-cluster
- **VPC ID**: Automatically create new
- **Subnets**: Automatically create new

#### Review cluster configuration

After you click `Next`, you will have the opportunity to review all of the properties that you set. Once you confirm that the settings are correct, click `Create` to setup your ECS.

You should now see a page where Amazon prepares the services we configured. There will be spinning icons on the right of each service that will live update as it finished. Once you see everything has setup properly, you're cluster has been successfully deployed!

#### Final steps

![](/screenshots/aws-ecs-final-steps.png)

1. Open the page with your cluster
1. Click on the _Tasks_ tab
1. You should see a task that has a status of `RUNNING` for _Last Status_
1. Click on the _Task ID_ link (e.g., 0b35dea-3ca..)
1. Under _Network_, you can find the URL for your instance under _Public IP_ (e.g., 18.18.134.18)
1. Open a new tab in your browser and visit this new URL on port 5000 (e.g., http://18.18.134.18:5000)

::: tip
The IP address can be mapped to a domain using Route53. We will be writing up a guide on how to do this. You can follow along at [meltano#625](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/issues/625).
:::

#### Configure network access

::: tip
This section is only necessary if you do not have a Security Group that allows for port 5000,5010 inbound.
:::

Once you complete the cluster setup, you should be brought to the detail page for the service. You should be default on a tab called _Details_ with a _Network Access_ section.

1. Navigate to the _Details_ tab
1. Under _Network Access_, click on the link next to _Security Groups_ (e.g., sg-f0dj093dkjf10)
1. This should open a new tab with your security group
1. Navigate to the _Inbound Rules_ tab on the bottom of the page
1. Click `Edit Rules`
1. Delete any existing rules
1. Click `Add Rule` with the following properties:

- **Type**: Custom TCP Rule
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Port Range**: 5000
- **Source**: Custom 0.0.0.0/0

1. Click "Add Rule" with the following properties:

- **Type**: Custom TCP Rule
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Port Range**: 5010
- **Source**: Custom 0.0.0.0/0

1. Click `Save rules`
