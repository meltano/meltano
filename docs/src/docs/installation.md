# Installation

::: tip
The quickest way to try out Meltano is to follow the [examples on the homepage](/).

They can be copy-pasted right onto your command line, and in a matter of minutes will take you all the way through [installation](/#installation), [integration](/#integration), [transformation](/#transformation), and [orchestration](/#orchestration) with the [`tap-gitlab` extractor](/plugins/extractors/gitlab.html) and [`target-jsonl`](/plugins/loaders/jsonl.html) and [`target-postgres`](/plugins/loaders/postgres.html) loaders.

:::

If the instructions on the homepage did not work on your environment, or if you'd like to learn more about how to manage your Meltano installation, you've come to the right place.

## Local Installation

In this section, we will install Meltano as a local application on your computer that you can access from your browser and on the command line.

### Requirements

Before you install Meltano, make sure you have the following requirements installed and up to date.

#### Unix-like environment

Recent versions of Linux and macOS are both fully supported, but Windows is not.

If you'd like to run Meltano on Windows, you can install it inside the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). You may also try [installing Meltano on Docker](#installing-on-docker), although Docker on Windows is known to have [some idiosyncrasies](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/issues/1261#note_240256080) that might hinder Meltano's ability to function.

#### Python 3.6 or Python 3.7

::: tip
You may refer to [https://realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for platform specific installation instructions.
:::

Use the following command to check that you have the correct Python version installed:

```bash
python --version
```

#### pip3

`pip` is a package installer that comes automatically with Python 3+. This is also what we will be using to install Meltano. Here are some commands related to `pip` that may be of interest:

```bash
# check for current version of pip to ensure that it is using Python 3
pip3 --version

# update pip3
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

#### Virtual Environment

::: danger IMPORTANT
Unless you are building a Docker image, it is **strongly recommended** that Meltano be installed inside a virtual environment in order to avoid potential system conflicts that may be difficult to debug.
:::

**Why use a virtual environment?**

Your local environment may use a different version of Python or other dependencies that are difficult to manage. The virtual environment provides a "clean" space to work without these issues.

#### Recommended Virtual Environment Setup

We suggest you create a directory where you want your virtual environments to be saved (e.g. `.venv/`). This can be any directory in your environment, but we recommend saving it in your Meltano project to make it easier to keep track of.

Then create a new virtual environment inside that directory:

```bash
mkdir .venv
python -m venv .venv/meltano
```

#### Activating Your Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using:

```bash
source .venv/meltano/bin/activate
```

If the virtual environment was activated successfully, you'll see a `(meltano)` indicator added to your prompt.

::: tip
Once a virtual environment is activated, it stays active until the current shell is closed. In a new shell, you must re-activate the virtual environment before interacting with the `meltano` command that will be installed in the next step.

To streamline this process, you can define a [shell alias](https://shapeshed.com/unix-alias/) that'll be easier to remember than the entire activation invocation:

```bash
# add to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc, depending on the shell you use:
alias meltano!="source $MELTANO_PROJECT_PATH/.venv/meltano/bin/activate"

# use as follows, after creating a new shell:
meltano!
```

You can deactivate a virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in your shell.

:::

### Install Meltano

Now that you have your virtual environment set up and running, run the following command to install the Meltano package:

```bash
pip3 install meltano
```

Once the installation completes, you can check if it was successful by running:

```bash
meltano --version
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed Meltano and its requirements, you can [create your first project](/docs/getting-started.html#create-your-first-project).

## Installing on Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an alternative installation option to [using a virtual environment to run Meltano](#virtual-environment). To use these instructions you will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) onto your computer and have it running when you execute the commands below.

### Using Pre-built Docker Images

We provide the [meltano/meltano](https://hub.docker.com/r/meltano/meltano) docker image with Meltano pre-installed and ready to use.

> Note: The **meltano/meltano** docker image is also available in GitLab's registry: `registry.gitlab.com`

This image contains everything you need to get started with Meltano.

```bash
# download or update to the latest version
docker pull meltano/meltano

# check the currently installed version
docker run meltano/meltano --version
```

### Initialize Your Project

Once you have Docker installed, running, and have pulled the pre-built image you can use Meltano just as you would in our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started.html). However, the command line syntax is slightly different. For example, let's create a new Meltano project:

```bash
cd /your/projects/directory

docker run -v $(pwd):/projects \
             -w /projects \
             meltano/meltano init yourprojectname
```

Then you can `cd` into your new project:

```bash
cd yourprojectname
```

We can then start the Meltano UI. Since `ui` is the default command, we can omit it.

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             -p 5000:5000 \
             meltano/meltano
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the Meltano UI.

Now that you're succesfully running Meltano, you can [set up your loader](/docs/getting-started.html#setup-your-loader).

Note that wherever you are asked to run the `meltano` command, you will want to run it through `docker run` as in the snippet above.

## Upgrading Meltano Version

We release new versions of Meltano every week. To keep tabs on the latest releases, follow along on the [Meltano blog](https://meltano.com/blog/), or have a look at our [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Using the command line

You can update Meltano to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal from inside a Meltano project:

```
meltano upgrade
```

### Using Meltano UI

When an update is available, you will be informed of this automatically through a shiny blue button in the top right corner of Meltano UI:

![](/screenshots/update-available.png)

Clicking this button will show more information and give you the option to install the update right away:

![](/screenshots/update-available-popup.png)

The Meltano UI will refresh automatically once installation is complete.
