# Roadmap

Meltano is an end-to-end data pipeline and dashboarding tool. We offer a free open source alternative to expensive business intelligence software with an integrated workflow for modeling, extracting, loading, transforming, analyzing, notebooking, and orchestrating your data.

Meltano was [launched in August 2018](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/08/01/hey-data-teams-we-are-working-on-a-tool-just-for-you/) by the GitLab Data & Analytics team, and is now an internal startup within GitLab.

## Mission

Meltano's mission aligns with the GitLab mission, which is "to change all creative work from read-only to read-write so that everyone can contribute."

When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of human progress.

## Vision

Our contribution to this progress comes through the democratization of data throughout organizations. We help our customers integrate a wide range of data sets to create a single source of truth.

Meltano develops powerful open source software enabling the creation of data pipelines and dashboards. By offering an integrated end-to-end solution leveraging best-in-class open source solutions, we deliver tools that are affordable for any company and easy to use at all levels of technical know-how.

## Strategy

### Path to V1.0

Meltano is approaching its v1 release. The criteria we have chosen for validating that we have achieved v1 are:

- Users can successfully run Meltano end-to-end
- Users can do everything from the UI (without having to run any commands on the command line)
- Users have clear documentation, including indication of all limitations to existing taps and targets
- Meltano core team is prepared to support backward compatibility to v1 (no breaking changes to architecture) until v2 version

### Beyond V1.0

There is a lot more to build. A few key areas we know we need to invest more time after V1 are:

- Data Analysis: adopt open source solution so we can bring in many more features without building from scratch
- One-click deployment to popular hosting solutions (e.g. Amazon AMI marketplace, DigitalOcean droplets, etc.)
- Creating and managing databases and warehouses
- Ongoing inclusion of more pre-built taps, targets, and default transforms for popular data sources

## Releases

Meltano currently follows a weekly release schedule on Mondays.

## MAUI

The focus of our team is to grow [MAUI](#maui) by 10% every week. We track the Monthly Active Users (MAU) of three things to understand the health of our user adoption funnel from first impression to fully onboarded user:

1. [Meltano.com Website](https://meltano.com)
2. [Meltano Command Line Interface - CLI](https://meltano.com/docs/command-line-interface.html)
3. [Meltano UI](https://meltano.com/docs/architecture.html#meltano-ui)

The MAU of the UI are called MAUI, this is pronounced like [the island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui).

Internal metrics:

1. [Google Analytics for MAUI](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?utm_source=marketingplatform.google.com&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=marketingplatform.google.com%2Fabout%2Fanalytics%2F#/report/visitors-actives/a132758957w192645310p188384771/_u.date00=20190209&_u.date01=20190308&active_users.metricKeys=%5B0,1,2,3%5D/)

## Focus

The focus of our team is to grow [MAUI](#maui) by 10% every week.
A week is measured from Sunday to Saturday.
Every improvement we make should be optimized by that.
This means sometimes we should prioritize promotion (blog, twitter, video, talk) and usability (docs, UX) over new features.

## Monetization

We are building Meltano to solve a problem that software companies share: How to acquire the highest-value customers at the lowest cost of acquisition?

We are solving this problem by incorporating what we learn along the way into a product that delivers practical and quantifiable value to our customers. Next, we will focus on building a community around Meltano with more users and regular contributors to the code base.

Right now Meltano is open source. In the future we'll introduce proprietary features to have a sustainable business model to do quality control, marketing, security, dependency upgrades, and performance improvements. An example of a proprietary/source available feature is fine grained access controls. We'll always be good [stewards similar to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/).

## Personas

Meltano provides tools to help data teams manage their end-to-end pipeline. This process usually involves collaboration between software engineers and data analysts. In the personas below, we have begun to capture our insights revealed from user interviews.

Ultimately, we are looking to help Meltano users successfully complete a wide range of user stories. To help users onboard quickly, we have created some [simple user stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axKIKtC65Zf9yAV6pApwbZD6Hml-EPh7HEg7W-fPbg0/edit) and we are working to support them through our tutorials.
