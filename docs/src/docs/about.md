# About

## Principles

We believe that information is the foundation of good decisions, and that companies of all sizes deserve insights into their operations. So Meltano provides broad, democratized access to detailed operational metrics, driving better decisions and shortening decision cycle time across the entire enterprise.

In addition, we believe that the information a business uses to make decisions must come from all parts of that business. Meltano joins data from multiple systems used by Sales, Marketing, Product and others, thereby providing a comprehensive view of the relationship between business activities, associated costs, and customer long-term value.

A data analyst or scientist should be able to easily use Meltano to add whatever data they need by writing the ELT, know the jobs that are running, and then analyze the data within Meltano Analyze. It should enable individual data people to own the full stack of their analysis, even [if theyâ€™re not engineers](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/).

### Milestones

Meltano runs in parallel with the data team with its 2-week milestones. Meltano team runs with 1-week milestones.

### Loosely Coupled Tools

All extractors and loaders should be self-contained units and [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling), i.e. an extractor should output data in its final form. An extractor should not rely on a loader to clean up its data.

### Product

The product is the glue to adhere the complete data science life cycle together and is built for 2 different team personas.

1. Team 1 wants a CLI, they have engineers in place to write the code, e.g. to make needed extractors.
2. Team 2 wants a GUI, they do not have engineers in place to write a lot of code.

For both teams, we provide a complete single source of truth solution. Single source of truth solution means:

- CLI: One CLI, with one command, with one config to extract, load, transform, remove PII, mock data and orchestrate.
- GUI: One single application to extract, load, transform, remove PII, mock data and orchestrate.

One GUI is also available for both personas for modeling and analysis. All data comes from files which are version controlled.

The orchestration will use the GitLab CI, but running it and configuring it will happen from the CLI or GUI.

## Approach

### Meltano is the market (data science) lifecycle, just like GitLab is the product (DevOps) lifecycle.

For many companies GitLab serves as the single data store for their engineering organization, shepherding their ideas all the way through to delivering them to customers. There are key gaps however in understanding the effectiveness of sales and marketing. By expanding the common data store to include go to market information, additional insights can be drawn across the customer lifecycle. This evolution is as follows:

1. Business intelligence; this is the current state of the project.
2. Data science; add more machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
3. Market lifecycle; the complete go-to-market lifecycle with the user/customer journey.

### Meltano is business intelligence (BI) as code.

Meltano uses [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) to set up and maintain its stack, so software and scripts required are checked into SCM with the attendant benefits: full version control, history, easy collaboration and reviews. Automated management of the BI environment means it is easy to make alterations, re-deploy in the event of an issue or outage, as well as provision new environments for different uses like a staging server.

Meltano also makes use of [review apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/), making a fresh clone of the data warehouse for each development branch. This means engineers can test changes to the data pipeline on real data, as well as major schema changes. Once everything is working, the changes can be reviewed, then merged and reflected safely in production.

### Evolution from an internal project, to a community, to open core

1. We are building Meltano to solve a problem that GitLab shares with all other software companies - how to acquire the highest-value customers at the lowest cost of acquisition? We are solving this problem for ourselves first, incorporating what we learn along the way into a product that delivers practical and quantifiable value to our customers.
2. Next, we'll focus on building a community around Meltano with more users and regular contributors to the code base.
3. Right now Meltano is open source. In the future we'll introduce proprietary features to have a sustainable business model to do quality control, marketing, security, dependency upgrades, and performance improvements. An example of a proprietary/source available feature is fine grained access controls. We'll always be good [stewards similar to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/).

### Competition & Value

This should be a replacement for other ELT & Data Integration tools: [Boomi](https://boomi.com/), [Informatica Cloud](https://www.informatica.com/products/cloud-integration/cloud-data-integration.html), and [Alooma](https://www.alooma.com/).

## At GitLab

Meltano is a separate product made by a separate team. The goal is at some point to spin it out of GitLab as a new company.

For now we use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the warehouse but we're open to support others such as [MariaDB AX](https://mariadb.com/products/solutions/olap-database-ax), [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [MemSQL](https://www.memsql.com/), and [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.net/).

We use dbt for testing too, instead of [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations), [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or closed source options such as [Informatica](https://marketplace.informatica.com/solutions/informatica_data_validation), [iCEDQ](https://icedq.com/), and [QuerySurge](http://www.querysurge.com/).

At GitLab we're using Looker instead of Superset, for sure for the rest of 2018.
If we switch we'll want to make sure that most of the functionality can be replicated in Superset, and the switch will be gradual.
For now, try to keep as much functionality as possible in dbt instead of Looker.

## Metrics

We are targeting analytics for sales and marketing performance first. We plan to track the following metrics, in order of priority. These results will be reviewed over various time periods. Initially, we will support single touch attribution, with support for multitouch in a later sprint.

1. SAOs by source
1. Aggregated (SDR / BDR / AE generated / Other)
1. Campaign level (AWS Reinvent / etc.)
1. SAOs by source by week and/or month
1. Acquisition cost per SAO

- Cost per lead = dollar spend / number of attributed leads

3. Estimated IACV and LTV per SAO based on history (can do IACV if LTV is hard to calculate)

- Estimated IACV = 2 \* IACV at median conversion time
- LTV = IACV _ margin _ average retention time

4. Estimated IACV / marketing ratio.

- CAC = cost per lead \* conversion from lead to IACV
- ROI = LTV / CAC

In the future, we plan to expand support to other areas of an organization like Customer Success, Human Resources, and Finance.

## Data sources

To achieve this, we bring data from all data sources to a common data model (that can and likely will be different for every organization) so it can be used easily and consistently across tools and teams. For example something as simple as unique customer ID, product or feature names/codes.

### Personally Identifiable Information

It is important to be cognizant of the personally identifiable information which is extracted into the data warehouse. Warehouses are at their best when they are leveraged across many parts of the organization, and therefore it is hard to predict which users will ultimately have access and how each user will treat the data.

We recommend the following best practices:

1. Avoid extracting any personally identifiable information in the first place. For example, consider extracting only company names from your CRM and avoid extracting individual contact details.
1. If it is important to collect data about individual users, for example, to learn more about user behavior, pseudonymize the data prior to writing it into the data warehouse.
1. Consider how you are persisting any PII data, and its impact on compliance requirements like GDPR.

## Tools

We want the tools to be open source so we can ship this as a product.

1. Extract and Load (EL): Python scripts, [Singer taps](https://www.singer.io/).
1. Transformation: [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/) to handle transforming the raw data into a normalized data model within PG.
1. Warehouse: Any SQL based data warehouse. We recommend [PostgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and include it in the Meltano pipeline. Postgres cloud services like [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) are also supported, for increased scalability and durability.
1. Orchestration/Monitoring: [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) for scheduling, running, and monitoring the ELT jobs. In the future, [DAG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41947) support will be added. Non-GitLab alternatives are [Airflow](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org) or [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi). GitLab CI can handle 1000's of distributed runners to run for example Python scripts.
1. Visualization/Dashboard: Meltano is compatible with nearly all visualization engines, due to the SQL based data store. For example commercial products like [Looker](https://looker.com/) or [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), as well as open-source products like [Superset](https://github.com/airbnb/superset) or [Metabase](https://metabase.com) can be used.

## Meltano Data Flow

Meltano uses Singer Taps and Targets to Extract the data from various data sources and load them in raw format, i.e. as close as possible to their original format, to the Data Warehouse. Subsequentially, the raw data is transformed to generate the dataset used for analysis and dashboard generation.

Meltano can be used in any ELT architecture by using the right taps and targets for the job. The strategies supported can range from dumping the source data in a data lake to keeping all historical versions for each record to storing well formatted, clean data in the target data store.

When considering which taps and targets Meltano will maintain, some assumptions are followed concerning how source data is stored in the target data store:
*  All extracted data is stored in the same Target Database, e.g., we use a Database named `RAW` for storing all extracted data to Snowflake.

*  For each tap's data source, a schema is created for storing all the data that is extracted through a tap. E.g., The `RAW.SALESFORCE` schema is used for data extracted from Salesforce, and the `RAW.ZENDESK` schema is used for data extracted from Zendesk.

*  Every stream generated from a tap will result in a table with the same name. That table will be created in the schema from that tap based on the information sent in the `SCHEMA` message.

*  Meltano supports schema updates for when a schema of an entity changes during an extraction. This is enacted when Meltano receives more than one `SCHEMA` message for a specific stream in the same extract load run.

    When a SCHEMA message for a stream is received, our Targets check whether there is already a table for the entity defined by the stream.
    * If the schema for the tap does not exist, it is created.
    * If the table for the stream does not exist, it is created.
    * If a table does exist, our Targets create a diff to check if new attributes must be added to the table or already defined attributes should have their data type updated. Based on that diff, the Targets make the appropriate schema changes.

    Rules followed:
    1. Only support type upgrades (e.g., STRING -> VARCHAR) for existing columns.
    2. If an unsupported type update is requested (e.g., float --> int), then an exception is raised.
    3. Columns are never dropped. Only UPDATE existing columns or ADD new columns.

*  Data is upserted when an entity has at least one primary key (key_properties not empty). If there is already a row with the same
composite key (combination of key_properties) then the new record updates the existing one.

    No key_properties must be defined for a target to work on append-only mode. In that case, the target tables will store historical information with entries for the same key differentiated by their `__loaded_at` timestamp.

*  If a timestamp_column attribute is not defined in the SCHEMA sent to the target for a specific stream, it is added explicitly. Each RECORD has the timestamp of when the target receives it as a value. As an example, `target-snowflake` sets the name of that attribute to `__loaded_at` when an explicit name is not provided in the target's configuration file.

    When a target is set to work on append-only mode (i.e. no primary keys defined for the streams), the timestamp_column's value can be used to get the most recent information for each record.

*  For targets loading data to Relational Data Stores (e.g., Postgres, Snowflake, etc.), we unnest nested JSON data structures and follow a `[object_name]__[property_name]` approach similar to [what Stitch platform also does](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/nested-data-structures-row-count-impact).

*  At the moment we do not deconstruct nested arrays. Arrays are stored as JSON or STRING data types (depending on the support provided by the target Data Store) with the relevant JSON representation stored as is. e.g. "['banana','apple']". It can then be extracted and used in the Transform Step.

## Differences between DAG and CI

We use Airflow to orchestrate Meltano jobs. Jobs can be Extract, Load, Transform etc. To see the difference between the GitLab CI and Airflow which would cover the difference between DAGs and a CI, see this [comprehensive issue](https://gitlab.com/meltano/analytics/issues/458).

## Personas

The personas are very much a work in progress and we will continue to add to them based on further insights revealed from user interviews.
