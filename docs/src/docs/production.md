# Deployment in Production

Once you've [set up a Meltano project](/#meltano-init) and
[run some pipelines](/#integration) on your local machine,
it'll be time to repeat this trick in production!

This page will help you figure out:

1. how to [get your Meltano project onto the production environment](#your-meltano-project),
2. how to [install Meltano](#installing-meltano),
3. how to [install your Meltano project's plugins](#installing-plugins),
4. where to [store your pipeline state and other metadata](#storing-metadata),
5. how to [manage your environment-specific and sensitive configuration](#managing-configuration), and finally
6. how to [run your pipelines](#running-pipelines).

Additionally, you may want to [run Meltano UI and configure it for production](#meltano-ui).

## Your Meltano project

### Off of your local machine...

Since a Meltano project is just a directory on your filesystem containing
text-based files, you can treat it like any other software development project
and benefit from DevOps best practices such as version control, code review,
and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

As such, getting your Meltano project onto the production environment starts
with getting it off of your local machine, and onto a (self-)hosted Git repository
platform like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com).

By default, your Meltano project comes with a `.gitignore` file to ensure that
environment-specific and potentially sensitive configuration stored inside the
`.meltano` directory and `.env` file is not leaked accidentally. All other files
are recommended to be checked into the repository and shared between all users
and environments that may use the project.

### ... and onto the production environment

Once your Meltano project is in version control, getting it to your production
environment can take various shapes.

In general, we recommend setting up a CI/CD pipeline to run automatically whenever
new changes are pushed to your reponsitory's default branch, that will connect with the
production environment and either directly push the project files, or trigger
some kind of mechanism to pull the latest changes from the repository.

A simpler (temporary?) approach would be to manually connect to the production
environment and pull the repository, right now while you're setting this up,
and/or later whenever changes are made.

### Containerized Meltano project

<!-- The following is reproduced from docs/src/README.md#containerization with minor edits in the first paragraph. -->

While you can get your Meltano project, [Meltano itself](#installing-meltano), and
[all of your project's plugins](#installing-plugins) onto a new environment one-by-one,
you can greatly simplify this process (and prevent issues caused by inconsistencies between environments!)
by wrapping them all up into a project-specific
[Docker container image](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container):
"a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything
needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

This image can then be used on any environment running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
(or a compatible tool like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)) to directly
[run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)
[`meltano` commands](/docs/command-line-interface.html)
in the context of your project, without needing to separately manage the installation of
Meltano, your project's plugins, or any of their dependencies.

If you're storing your Meltano project in version control on a
platform like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com),
you can set up a CI/CD pipeline to run every time a change is made to your project,
which can automatically [build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
a new version of the image and [push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/)
it to a container registry.
The image can then be [pulled](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/)
from that registry onto any local or cloud environment on which you'd like to run your project's pipelines.

If you'd like to containerize your Meltano project, you can easily add the
appropriate `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` files to your project by adding the
[`docker` file bundle](https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-docker).

If you'd like to use [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) to continuously
build your Meltano project's Docker image and push it to GitLab's built-in
[Container Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/),
you can add the appropriate `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.gitlab/ci/docker.gitlab-ci.yml`
files to your project by adding the
[`gitlab-ci` file bundle](https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-gitlab-ci).

## Installing Meltano

Just like on your local machine, the most straightforward way to install Meltano
onto a production environment is to
[use `pip` to install the `meltano` package from PyPI](/docs/installation.html#local-installation).

If you add `meltano` (or `meltano==<version>`) to your project's `requirements.txt`
file, you can choose to automatically run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your
production environment whenever the Meltano project is updated to ensure you're always
on the latest (or requested) version.

### Containerized Meltano project

If you're [containerizing your Meltano project](#containerized-meltano-project),
your project-specific Docker image will already contain a Meltano installation
since it's built from the [`meltano/meltano`](https://hub.docker.com/r/meltano/meltano) base image.

## Installing plugins

Whenever you [add a new plugin](/#meltano-add) to a Meltano project, it will be
installed into your project's `.meltano` directory automatically.
However, since this directory is included in your project's `.gitignore` file
by default, you'll need to explicitly run [`meltano install`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#install)
before any other `meltano` commands whenever you clone or pull an existing Meltano project from version control,
to install (or update) all plugins specified in `meltano.yml`.

Thus, it is strongly recommended that you automatically run `meltano install` on your
production environment whenever the Meltano project is updated to ensure you're always
using the correct versions of plugins.

### Containerized Meltano project

If you're [containerizing your Meltano project](#containerized-meltano-project),
your project-specific Docker image will already contain all of your project's plugins
since `meltano install` is a step in its build process.

## Storing metadata

Meltano stores pipeline state and other metadata in a project-specific
[system database](/docs/settings.html#database-uri), which takes
the shape of a SQLite database stored inside the project at `.meltano/meltano.db`
by default. Like all files stored in the `.meltano` directory (which you'll remember
is included in your project's `.gitignore` file by default), the system database is
also environment-specific.

While SQLite is great for use during local development and testing since it
requires no external database to be set up, it has various limitations that make
it inappropriate for use in production. Since it's a simple file, it only supports
one concurrent connection, for example.

Thus, it is is strongly recommended that you use a PostgreSQL system database in
production instead. You can configure Meltano to use it using the
[`database_uri` setting](/docs/settings.html#database-uri).

### Containerized Meltano project

If you're [containerizing your Meltano project](#containerized-meltano-project),
you will _definitely_ want to use an external system database, since changes to
`.meltano/meltano.db` would not be persisted outside the container.

## Managing configuration

All of your Meltano project's configuration that is _not_ environment-specific
or sensitive should be stored in its `meltano.yml` file and checked into version
control.

Configuration that _is_ environment-specific or sensitive is [most appropriately
managed using environment variables](https://12factor.net/config). How these can
be best administered will depend on your deployment strategy and destination.

If you'd like to store sensitive configuration in a secrets store, you can
consider using the [`chamber` CLI](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber), which
lets you store secrets in the
[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)
that can then be exported as environment variables when
[executing an arbitrary command](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber#exec)
like `meltano`.

### Containerized Meltano project

If you're [containerizing your Meltano project](#containerized-meltano-project),
you will want to manage sensitive configuration using the mechanism provided
by your container runner, e.g.
[Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) or
[Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

## Running pipelines

### `meltano elt`

If all of the above has been set up correctly, you should now be able to run
a pipeline using [`meltano elt`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#elt),
just like you did locally. Congratulations!

You can run the command using any mechanism capable of running executables,
whether that's `cron`, [Airflow's `BashOperator`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/howto/operator/bash.html),
or any of dozens of other orchestration tools.

### Airflow orchestrator

If you've added Airflow to your Meltano project as an [orchestrator](/#orchestration),
you can have it automatically run your project's [scheduled pipelines](/#orchestration)
by starting [its scheduler](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/cli-ref.html#scheduler)
using `meltano invoke airflow scheduler`.

Similarly, you can start [its web interface](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/cli-ref.html#webserver)
using `meltano invoke airflow webserver`.

However, do take into account Airflow's own
[Best Practices on Deployment in Production](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/best-practices.html#deployment-in-production). Specifically, you will want to configure Airflow to:

- [use a PostgreSQL (or MySQL) metadata database](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/best-practices.html#database-backend)
  instead of the SQLite default ([sounds familiar?](#storing-metadata)) by
  setting the `AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN` environment variable to a
  [`postgresql://` URI](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#postgresql)
  (or [`mysql://` URI](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#mysql)),
  and to
- [use the `LocalExecutor`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/best-practices.html#multi-node-cluster)
  instead of the `SequentialExecutor` default by setting the `AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR`
  environment variable to `LocalExecutor`.

### Containerized Meltano project

If you're [containerizing your Meltano project](#containerized-meltano-project),
the built image's [entrypoint](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint)
will be [the `meltano` command](/docs/command-line-interface.html),
meaning that you can provide `meltano` subcommands and arguments like `elt ...` and `invoke airflow ...` directly to
[`docker run <image-name> ...`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)
as trailing arguments.

## Meltano UI

Now that your pipelines are running, you may want to also spin up [Meltano UI](/docs/command-line-interface.html#ui),
which lets you quickly check the status and most recent logs of your project's [scheduled pipelines](/#orchestration) right from your browser.

You can start Meltano UI using [`meltano ui`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#ui) just like you would locally,
but there are [a couple of settings](/docs/settings.html#meltano-ui-server) you'll want to consider changing in production:

- By default, Meltano UI will bind to host `0.0.0.0` and port `5000`.
  This can be changed using the [`ui.bind_host`](/docs/settings.html#ui-bind-host) and [`ui.bind_port`](/docs/settings.html#ui-bind-port) settings, and their respective environment variables and CLI flags.

- If you'd like to require users to sign in before they can access the Meltano UI, enable the [`ui.authentication` setting](/docs/settings.html#ui-authentication).
  As described behind that link, this will also require you to set the [`ui.secret_key`](/docs/settings.html#ui-secret-key) and [`ui.password_salt`](/docs/settings.html#ui-password-salt) settings, as well as [`ui.server_name`](/docs/settings.html#ui-server-name) or [`ui.session_cookie_domain`](/docs/settings.html#ui-session-cookie-domain). Users can be added using [`meltano user add`](./command-line-interface.html#user) and will be stored in the configured [system database](#storing-metadata).

- Meltano UI can be used to make changes to your project, like adding plugins and scheduling pipelines,
  which is very useful locally but may be undesirable in production if you'd prefer for all changes to [go through version control](#off-of-your-local-machine) instead.
  To disallow all modifications to project files through the UI, enable the [`project_readonly` setting](/docs/settings.html#project-readonly).

- If you will be running Meltano UI behind a front-end (reverse) proxy that will be responsible for SSL termination,
  you may need to change the [`ui.forwarded_allow_ips` setting](/docs/settings.html#ui-forwarded-allow-ips) to get
  Meltano UI to realize it should use the `https` URL scheme rather than `http` in the URLs it builds.

### Containerized Meltano project

If you're [containerizing your Meltano project](#containerized-meltano-project),
the [`project_readonly` setting](/docs/settings.html#project-readonly) will be
[enabled by default](https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-docker/-/blob/master/bundle/Dockerfile#L17)
using the `MELTANO_PROJECT_READONLY` environment variable,
since any changes to your project's `meltano.yml` file would not be persisted outside the container.
