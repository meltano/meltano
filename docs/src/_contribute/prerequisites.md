## Prerequisites

In order to contribute to Meltano, you will need the following:

1. [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For more details about Python requirements, refer to the ["Requirements" section](/guide/installation#requirements) of the Installation instructions, that also apply here.
2. [Node 8.11.0+](https://nodejs.org/)
3. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the Meltano repo
git clone git@gitlab.com:meltano/meltano.git

# Change directory into the Meltano project
cd meltano

# Install the Poetry tool for managing dependencies and packaging
pip3 install poetry

# Install all the dependencies
poetry install

# Install the pre-commit hook
poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks

# Bundle the Meltano UI into the `meltano` package
make bundle
```

Meltano is now installed and available at `meltano`, as long as you remain in your virtual environment defined by poetry!
If you're using VSCode to manage the terminal, you can update the interpreter to always use poetry so all meltano commands work as you expect. 

You can also run meltano by prefixing all commands with `poetry run meltano...` if you're running outside of the poetry-defined virtual environment. 



This means that you're ready to start Meltano CLI development. For API and UI development, read on.

<div class="notification is-warning">
  <p><strong>Metrics (anonymous usage data) tracking</strong></p>
  <p>As you contribute to Meltano, you may want to disable <a href="/reference/settings#send-anonymous-usage-stats">metrics tracking</a> globally rather than by project. You can do this by setting the environment variable `MELTANO_DISABLE_TRACKING` to `True`:</p>
<pre>
# Add to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc, depending on the shell you use:
export MELTANO_DISABLE_TRACKING=True
</pre>
</div>



## System Database

Meltano API and CLI are both supported by a database that is managed using Alembic migrations.

<div class="notification is-warning">
  <p><strong><a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">Alembic</a> is a full featured database migration working on top of SQLAlchemy.</strong></p>
</div>

Migrations for the system database are located inside the `meltano.migrations` module.

To create a new migration, use the `alembic revision -m "message"` command, then edit the created file with the necessary database changes. Make sure to implement both `upgrade` and `downgrade`, so the migration is reversible, as this will be used in migration tests in the future.

Each migration should be isolated from the `meltano` module, so **don't import any model definition inside a migration**.

<div class="notification is-danger">
  <p><strong>Meltano doesn't currently support auto-generating migration from the models definition.</strong></p>
  <p></p>
</div>

To run the migrations, use `meltano upgrade` inside a Meltano project.



## Testing

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

Our end-to-end tests are currently being built with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

#### How to Run Tests

1. Initialize a new meltano project with `meltano init $PROJECT_NAME`
1. Change directory into `$PROJECT_NAME`
1. Start up project with `meltano ui`
1. Clone Meltano repo
1. Open Meltano repo in Terminal
1. Run `yarn setup`
1. Run `yarn test:e2e`

This will kick off a Cypress application that will allow you to run tests as desired by clicking each test suite (which can be found in `/src/tests/e2e/specs/*.spec.js`)

<div class="notification is-info">
  <p><strong>In the near future, all tests can flow automatically; but there are some complications that require manual triggering due to an inability to read pipeline completion.</strong></p>
  <p></p>

## Tmuxinator

Tmuxinator is a way for you to efficiently manage multiple services when starting up Meltano.

### Why Tmuxinator?

In order to run applications, you need to run multiple sessions and have to do a lot of repetitive tasks (like sourcing your virtual environments). So we have created a way for you to start and track everything in its appropriate panes with a single command.

1. Start up Docker
1. Start Meltano API
1. Start the web app

It's a game changer for development and it's worth the effort!

### Requirements

1. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - Recommended to install with brew
1. [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)

This config uses `$MELTANO_VENV` to source the virtual environment from. Set it to the correct directory before running tmuxinator.

### Instructions

1. Make sure you know what directory your virtual environment is. It is normally `.venv` by default.
1. Run the following commands. Keep in mind that the `.venv` in line 2 refers to your virtual environment directory in Step #1.

```bash
cd path/to/meltano
MELTANO_VENV=.venv tmuxinator local
```
