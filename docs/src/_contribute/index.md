## Code of Conduct

Before getting started, please make sure you review our Code of Conduct. Everyone interacting in Slack, codebases, issue trackers, mailing lists, events, or other Meltano activities is expected to follow [this code of conduct][psfconduct]. If you are unable to abide by the code of conduct set forth here, we encourage you not to participate in the community. If you see a violation please notify us by messaging `@Amanda Folson` on Slack.


## Where to start?

If you'd like to contribute, but you're not sure _what_, check out the list of open issues labeled [Accepting Merge Requests].
Any other improvements are welcome too, of course, so simply asking yourself "What about Meltano didn't work quite as smoothly as I would've liked?" is another good way to come up with ideas.

If an issue for your problem or suggested improvement doesn't exist yet on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues),
please [file a new one](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/new) before submitting a [merge request](#merge-requests),
so that the team and community are aware of your plan and can help you figure out the best way to realize it.




Meltano is built for and by its community, and we welcome your contributions to our [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano),
which houses Meltano's
[core](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/tree/master/src/meltano/core),
[CLI](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/tree/master/src/meltano/cli),
[UI](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/tree/master/src/webapp),
[UI API](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/tree/master/src/meltano/api),
[these docs](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/tree/master/docs/src), and
the [index of discoverable plugins](#discoverable-plugins),
which feeds the lists of [Extractors](https://hub.meltano.com/extractors/) and [Loaders](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/) that are supported out of the box.
