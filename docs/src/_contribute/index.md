## Where do I start?

If you'd like to contribute, but you're not sure _what_, check out the list of open issues labeled [Accepting Merge Requests](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name[]=Accepting+Merge+Requests). Any other improvements are welcome too, of course, so simply asking yourself "What could have been better while I was using Meltano?" is another good way to come up with ideas.

If an issue for your problem or suggested improvement doesn't exist yet on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues),
please [file a new one](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/new) before submitting a [merge request](/contribute/merge),
so that the team and community are aware of your plan and can help you figure out the best way to realize it.
