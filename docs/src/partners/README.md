## Data products

Meltano is a great fit for data products that want to let their users directly connect their own sources to the platform,
since connectors for many [taps](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/taps) and [targets](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/targets) are already available,
new connectors can be created easily, and connectors and pipelines can be configured programmatically.

These are some of the tools powered by Meltano:

- [Blotout](https://blotout.io)
- [Halosight](https://halosight.com)
- [Matatika](https://matatika.com)
- [Qualytics](https://qualytics.co)

## Connector maintainers

Any [Singer](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/) tap or target can be used with Meltano as a [custom plugin](/docs/plugin-management.html#custom-plugins),
and many of them are supported out of the box as [extractors](https://hub.meltano.com/extractors) and [loaders](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders).

The full list of connector maintainers can be found on [MeltanoHub](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/maintainers/).
