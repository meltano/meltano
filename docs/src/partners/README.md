[maintainers of connectors](#connector-maintainers) that are supported out of the box, and
[data products](#data-products) that use Meltano to offer built-in data integration.

## Consulting firms

Meltano and [Singer](https://www.singer.io/) are [popular with data consultants](/docs/#focus), and various consulting firms have adopted both as part of the stack they offer to clients.

If you lack the time and/or expertise to do so yourself, they can help you
[set up](/docs/getting-started.html) your pipelines, deploy them to [production](/docs/production.html),
[improve](/docs/plugin-management.html#using-a-custom-fork-of-a-plugin) existing Singer taps and targets to fit your use case,
and [build new ones](/tutorials/create-a-custom-extractor.html) for any [taps](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/taps) and [targets](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/targest)
that are not supported yet.

but [extractors](/docs/plugins.html#extractors) and [loaders](/docs/plugins.html#loaders) for various

## Data products

Meltano is a great fit for data products that want to let their users directly connect their own sources to the platform,
since connectors for many [taps](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/taps) and [targets](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/targest) are already available,
new connectors can be created easily, and connectors and pipelines can be configured programmatically.

These are some of the tools powered by Meltano:

- [Blotout](https://blotout.io)
- [Halosight](https://halosight.com)
- [Matatika](https://matatika.com)
- [Qualytics](https://qualytics.co)
