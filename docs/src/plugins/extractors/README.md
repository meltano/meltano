# Sources (Extractors)

Meltano lets you easily extract data out of arbitrary data sources (databases, SaaS APIs, and file formats) using [Singer taps](https://www.singer.io/), which take the role of [your project](/docs/project.html)'s [extractor plugins](/docs/plugins.html#extractors).


Extractors for the following sources are currently [discoverable](/docs/plugins.html#discoverable-plugins) and supported out of the box:

- [Bing Ads](/plugins/extractors/bing-ads.html)
- [BigQuery](/plugins/extractors/bigquery.html)
- [Comma Separated Values (CSV)](/plugins/extractors/csv.html)
- [Facebook Ads](/plugins/extractors/facebook.html)
- [Fastly](/plugins/extractors/fastly.html)
- [GitLab](/plugins/extractors/gitlab.html)
- [Google Ads](/plugins/extractors/adwords.html)

To learn more about extracting and [loading](/plugins/loaders/) data using Meltano, refer to the [Data Integration (EL) guide](/docs/integration.html).

::: tip Don't see your data source listed here?

If a [Singer tap](https://www.singer.io/#taps) for your source already exists,
it can easily be [added to your project as a custom extractor](/docs/command-line-interface.html#how-to-use-custom-plugins).
If not, you can learn how to [create your own from scratch](/tutorials/create-a-custom-extractor.html).

Once you've got the new extractor working in your project, please consider
[contributing its definition](/docs/contributor-guide.html#discoverable-plugins)
to the [index of discoverable plugins](/docs/plugins.html#discoverable-plugins)
so that it can be added to this page!
