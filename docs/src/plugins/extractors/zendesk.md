:::tip Configuration Notes

- The subdomain you access when using Zendesk

:::

### Zendesk Subdomain

:::tip Configuration Notes

- If the URL is `meltano.zendesk.com`, then the subdomain is `meltano`.

:::

When visiting your Zendesk instance, the URL is structured as follows:

```
SUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com
```

You'll need this subdomain when configuring the extractor.

For example, if the URL is `meltano.zendesk.com`, then the subdomain is `meltano`.

### Start Date

This property determines how much historical data will be extracted.

Please be aware that the larger the time period and amount of data, the longer the initial extraction can be expected to take.

## Advanced: Command Line Installation

1. Navigate to your Meltano project in the terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
meltano add extractor tap-zendesk
```

If you are successful, you should see `Added and installed extractors 'tap-zendesk'` in your terminal.

### Configuration

1. Open your project's `.env` file in a text editor
1. Add the following variables to your file:

```bash
export TAP_ZENDESK_EMAIL="yourZendeskEmail"
export TAP_ZENDESK_API_TOKEN="yourZendeskApiToken"
export TAP_ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN="yourZendeskSubdomain"
# The date uses ISO-8601 and supports time if desired
export TAP_ZENDESK_START_DATE="yourZendeskStartDate"
```
