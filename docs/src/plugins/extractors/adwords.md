# Google Ads

The Google Ads extractor pulls raw data from Google's [AdWords API](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/start) and extracts the following resources from a Google Ads account:

- [Accounts / Managed Customer](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/reference/v201705/ManagedCustomerService.ManagedCustomer)
- [Campaigns](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/reference/v201705/CampaignService.Campaign)
- [Ad Groups](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/reference/v201705/AdGroupService.AdGroup)
- [Ads](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/reference/v201705/AdGroupAdService.AdGroupAd)
- [Ad Performance Report](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/ad-performance-report)
- [Keywords Performance Report](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/keywords-performance-report)

Note that [Smart Campaigns](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7652860) are not supported, and their performance data is not available to Meltano.

For more information you can check [the documentation for tap-adwords](https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-adwords).

## Google Ads Setup

In order to access your Google Ads data, you will need the following:

- Account ID(s)
- Access Token
- Start Date

<h3 id="customer-ids">Account ID(s)</h3>

One or more Google Ads Account IDs to extract data from.

To get your Account ID(s):

1. Visit the Google Ads management interface: <https://ads.google.com/>
2. Log in if you haven't already.
3. Make sure the correct account is selected in the top left corner.

4. You will see the Account ID displayed inside the selector to the right of the account name, with added dashes for readability.

Remove the dashes before you enter the ID in Meltano: `205-667-8813` becomes `2056678813`.

If you want to extract data from multiple Ad Accounts, repeat the steps above to find the IDs (without dashes), and enter them in Meltano separated by commas (`,`).

For example:
- One Account ID: `1234567890`
- Multiple Account IDs: `1234567890,1234567891,1234567892`

<h3 id="refresh-token">Access Token</h3>

The Refresh Token generated through the OAuth flow run using your OAuth Client and your Developer Token.

The Google account you connect needs to have access to your Ads Account.

If you want to manually generate a Refresh Token, check out  [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/first-api-call#get_an_oauth2_refresh_token_and_configure_your_client).

<h3 id="start-date">Start Date</h3>

This property determines how much historical data will be extracted.

Please be aware that the larger the time period and amount of data, the longer the initial extraction can be expected to take.

## Meltano Setup

::: warning Self-Hosted
Please note that this extractor requires advanced configuration for self-hosted Meltano instances.

If you do not have (1) a developer token for your Google Ads Account and (2) an approved Google OAuth Client, the process that you have to go through to generate those may take between one and four weeks.

### Prerequisites

- [Running instance of Meltano](/docs/getting-started.html)
- A valid [Google OAuth 2.0 Client](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), including:
  - [Your Developer Token for Google AdWords](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/first-api-call#request_a_developer_token)
  - [Your Google OAuth Client ID](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/first-api-call#set_up_oauth2_authentication)
  - [Your Google OAuth Client Secret](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/first-api-call#set_up_oauth2_authentication)

### Configure the OAuth Client

The following variables are required for the authentication flow:

#### Configuration

1. Add the following variables to your file:

```bash
export OAUTH_GOOGLE_ADWORDS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=<developer_token>
export OAUTH_GOOGLE_ADWORDS_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
export OAUTH_GOOGLE_ADWORDS_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
```

### Configuration with the Meltano UI
