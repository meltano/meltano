# Google Analytics

The Google Analytics extractor pulls raw data from the [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/).

## Google Analytics Setup

In order to access your Google Analytics data, you will need:

1. The ID for the Google Analytics View you want to fetch data from.

   You can easily find it by using [Google Analytics Account Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/account-explorer/).

2. Authorization to access your Google Analytics account.

   This extractor supports service account based authorization, where an administrator manually creates a service account with the appropriate permissions to view the account, property, and view you wish to fetch data from.

   To access your Google Analytics Account, it needs the Analytics Reporting API *and* the Analytics API enabled. These need to be enabled for a project inside the same organization as your Google Analytics account (check the next section for more details).

3. A way to authenticate when accessing the Analytics APIs

   When you create a service account Google gives you a json file with that service account's credentials called the `client_secrets.json`, and that's all you need to pass to this tap.

### Creating Service Account Credentials

::: tip
If you have a valid `client_secrets.json` for a service account, you can skip this section.
:::

As a first step, you need to create or use an existing project in the Google Developers Console:

1. Sign in to the Google Account you are using for managing Google Analytics (you must have Manage Users permission at the account, property, or view level).

2. Open the [Service accounts page](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts). If prompted, select a project or create a new one to use for accessing Google Analytics.

3. Click "Create service account"

   In the Create service account window, type a name for the service account, and select Furnish a new private key. Then click Save and store it locally in your Meltano project directory as `client_secrets.json`.

   If you already have a service account, you can generate a key by selecting 'Edit' for the account and then selecting the option to generate a key.

Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine; it serves as the only copy of this key. You are responsible for storing it securely.

### Linking Credentials to Google Analytics

The newly created service account will have an email address that looks similar to:

```
quickstart@PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Use this email address to [add a user](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702) to the Google analytics view you want to access via the API. Only [Read & Analyze permissions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) are needed.

### Enabling the APIs

1. Visit the [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsreporting.googleapis.com/overview) dashboard and make sure that the project you used in the previous step is selected.

   From this dashboard, you can enable/disable the API for your account, set Quotas and check usage stats for the service account you are using with the Google Analytics extractor.

2. Visit the [Google Analytics API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analytics.googleapis.com/overview) dashboard, make sure that the project you used in the previous step is selected, and enable the API for your account.

## Meltano Setup

### Prerequisites

* [Running instance of Meltano](/docs/getting-started.html)

### Configure the Extractor

Open your Meltano instance and click "Pipelines" in the top navigation bar. You should see now see the Extractors page, which contains various options for connecting your data source.

![Screenshot of Meltano UI with all extractors not installed and Google Analytics highlighted](/images/google-analytics-tutorial/01-ga-extractor-selection.png)

Let's install `tap-google-analytics` by clicking on the `Install` button inside its card.

On the configuration modal enter the View ID you retrieved using [Google Analytics Account Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/account-explorer/) and the start date you want to extract data for. If you leave the end date empty, `tap-google-analytics` sets it to yesterday.

Click `Save` to finish configuring the extractor and progress to the next step: "Entity Selection".

### Select Entities

Data sources can contain a lot of different entities. As a result, you might not want Meltano to pull every data source into your dashboard. As you can see on your screen, all of the entities are currently selected by default for `tap-google-analytics`.

![Screenshot of Google Analytics Extractor Entity Selection](/images/google-analytics-tutorial/03-ga-entity-selection.png)

We want to select all the default Entities (reports in the case of Google Analytics) that Meltano extracts, so click `Save` to finish configuring our extractor.

## Advanced: Command Line Installation

1. Navigate to your Meltano project in the terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
meltano add extractor tap-google-analytics
```

If you are successful, you should see `Added and installed extractors 'tap-google-analytics'` in your terminal.

### Configuration
