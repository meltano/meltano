# Google Analytics

The Google Analytics extractor pulls raw data from the [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/).

## Google Analytics Setup

In order to access your Google Analytics data, you will need:

- Key File Location
- View ID
- Reports
- Start Date
- End Date

### Key File Location

:::tip Configuration Notes

- Follow the steps below if you don't already have a valid `client_secrets.json` to upload
- The process below can take over 10 minutes, but it's a one-time setup that's well worth it
  :::

This extractor supports service account based authorization, where an administrator manually creates a service account with the appropriate permissions to view the account, property, and view you wish to fetch data from.

To access your Google Analytics Account, it needs the Analytics Reporting API _and_ the Analytics API enabled. These need to be enabled for a project inside the same organization as your Google Analytics account.

#### Creating Service Account Credentials

As a first step, you need to create or use an existing project in the Google Developers Console:

1. Sign in to the Google Account you are using for managing Google Analytics (you must have Manage Users permission at the account, property, or view level).

2. Open the [Service accounts page](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts). If prompted, select a project or create a new one to use for accessing Google Analytics.

3. Click "Create service account"

   In the Create service account window, type a name for the service account, and select Furnish a new private key. Then click Save and store it locally as `client_secrets.json`.

   If you already have a service account, you can generate a key by selecting 'Edit' for the account and then selecting the option to generate a key.

Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine; it serves as the only copy of this key. You are responsible for storing it securely.

A way to authenticate when accessing the Analytics APIs

When you create a service account Google gives you a json file with that service account's credentials called the `client_secrets.json`, and that's all you need to pass to this tap.

#### Linking Credentials to Google Analytics

The newly created service account will have an email address that looks similar to:

```
quickstart@PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Use this email address to [add a user](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702) to the Google analytics view you want to access via the API. Only [Read & Analyze permissions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) are needed.

#### Enabling the APIs

1. Visit the [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsreporting.googleapis.com/overview) dashboard and make sure that the project you used in the previous step is selected.

   From this dashboard, you can enable/disable the API for your account, set Quotas and check usage stats for the service account you are using with the Google Analytics extractor.

2. Visit the [Google Analytics API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analytics.googleapis.com/overview) dashboard, make sure that the project you used in the previous step is selected, and enable the API for your account.

### View ID

:::tip Configuration Notes

- You can easily find the **View ID** for the Google Analytics View you want to fetch data from by using the [Google Analytics Account Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/account-explorer/).

### Reports

:::tip Configuration Notes

- An _optional_ JSON file defining the reports to be generated

:::

Optionally, you can provide an additional JSON file for the definition of the reports to be generated. You can check, as an example, the JSON file used as a default in [tap-google-analytics/defaults/default_report_definition.json](https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-google-analytics/blob/master/tap_google_analytics/defaults/default_report_definition.json). Those report definitions could be part of the config.json, but we prefer to keep config.json small and clean and provide the definitions by using an additional file.

### Start Date

:::tip Configuration Notes

- Determines how much historical data will be extracted. Please be aware that the larger the time period and amount of data, the longer the initial extraction can be expected to take.

:::

This property allows you to configure where you want your data set to start from. Otherwise, if left blank, it will try to fetch the entire history of the groups or projects specified.

### End Date

:::tip Configuration Notes

- Restricts how much historical data will be extracted in relation to the **Start Date**

:::

This property allows you to configure where you want your data set to end in relation to the **Start Date**.

## Meltano Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Running instance of Meltano](/docs/getting-started.html)

### Configuration

Open your Meltano instance and click "Pipelines" in the top navigation bar. You should now see the Extractors page, which contains various options for connecting your data source.

Let's install `tap-google-analytics` by clicking on the `Connect` button inside its card.

For the **Key File Location**, you will need to upload your `client_secrets.json` using the file uploader.

For the **View ID**, enter the ID you retrieved using [Google Analytics Account Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/account-explorer/)

For the **Start Date**, choose the date when you want to start extracting data for.

For the **End Date**, it is set to yesterday by default if you do not configure a date. However, you can choose to set a specific end date for your data set if you want.

Click `Save` to finish configuring the extractor and progress to the next step: "Configure the Loader".

## Advanced: Command Line Installation

1. Navigate to your Meltano project in the terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
meltano add extractor tap-google-analytics
```

If you are successful, you should see `Added and installed extractors 'tap-google-analytics'` in your terminal.

### Configuration

1. Open your project's `.env` file in a text editor
1. Add the following variables to your file:

Required:

```bash
export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_CLIENT_SECRETS="client_secrets.json"
export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_VIEW_ID="YOUR VIEW ID"
export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_START_DATE="2019-02-01T00:00:00Z"
```

Optional:

```bash
export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_REPORTS="cli_reports.json"
export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_END_DATE="2019-06-01T00:00:00Z"
```
