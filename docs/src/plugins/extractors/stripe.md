# Stripe

`tap-stripe` is an extractor that pulls data from Stripe's API and produces JSON-formatted data following the [Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

## Stripe Setup

In order to access your Stripe data, you will need:

- Account ID
- Secret API key
- Start Date

### Account ID

:::tip Configuration Notes

- The account ID (e.g., `acct_152Bdedkol54`) is attained from your Stripe account profile

:::

To get your account ID:

1. Visit your profile: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user)

   - Or in the upper right, click on the avatar to access a dropdown, and click on `Profile`

:::tip Configuration Notes

- The secret API key (e.g., `sk_live_eis72wonf921pqjdf`) is accessible in your Stripe account when signed in

:::

To get your secret API key:

1. Visit your Developer API Keys page: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)

   - You can find this by clicking on the `Developers` link on the left navigation and clicking on `API Keys`

2. Under the `Standard keys` section, click on the button to `Create secret key`

:::tip No button?

If the "Create secret key" button is not available, a secret key may already have been generated before.
In this case, use the "Reveal live key token" button under "Token" and to the right of "Secret key". The token that appears is the secret key you can copy and paste into the data source configuration.

3. To make things easy to track, assign the secret key a name of `Meltano` so you know why you created the key

4. Once you click on `Create`, you should be greeted with you new API key which you'll copy and paste into the data source configuration.

### Start Date

This property determines how much historical data will be extracted.

Please be aware that the larger the time period and amount of data, the longer the initial extraction can be expected to take.

## Advanced: Command Line Installation

1. Navigate to your Meltano project in the terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
meltano add extractor tap-stripe
```

If you are successful, you should see `Added and installed extractors 'tap-stripe'` in your terminal.

### Configuration

1. Open your project's `.env` file in a text editor
1. Add the following variables to your file:

```bash
# Can be found in your Profile
export STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID="yourAccountId"
# Create a new secret key for Meltano
export STRIPE_API_KEY="yourStripeApiKey"
# The date uses ISO-8601 and supports time if desired
export TAP_STRIPE_START_DATE="YYYY-MM-DD"
```
