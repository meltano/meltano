As part of Meltano's vision to enable data teams to operate with best practices, __Environments__ allows
you to define custom layers of configuration within your project. That way, You can run the same commands against multiple environments,
by passing a single environment variable or CLI option.

This reduces the number of environment variables you need to set (and switch between), and at the same time,
eliminates the need for managing and toggling between multiple `.env` files.

A set of environment definitions looks like this within `meltano.yml`:

```yaml
environments:
- name: prod
  config:
    plugins:
      extractors:
      - name: tap-github
        config:
          organizations: [Meltano]
        select: ["*.*"]
      loaders:
      - name: target-snowflake
        config:
          dbname: prod
          warehouse: prod_wh
          batch_size_rows: 100000
  env:
    SOME_PROD_ONLY_SETTING: abc
- name: dev
  config:
    plugins:
      extractors:
      - name: tap-github
        config:
          organizations: [MeltanoLabs]
        select: ["repositories.*"]
      loaders:
      - name: target-snowflake
        config:
          dbname: dev
          warehouse: dev_wh
          batch_size_rows: 1000
```

  <p><strong>Environments vs Python Virtual Environments</strong></p>
  <p>For installable Python plugins (i.e. those with a <a href="project#plugins"><code>pip_url</code></a> property) configured across multiple Environments, the same Python virtual environment and executable are reused.</p>
  <p>To install different versions of the same plugin, you can use <a href="plugins#plugin-inheritance">plugin inheritance</a> and set a different <code>pip_url</code> in the inherited plugin.</p>
</div>

## Inheritance

Environments are most powerful when [inheriting](plugins#plugin-inheritance) from a base plugin definition.
Configuration that is set in an environment can be used to add or override configuration set in the base plugin configuration.
This enables reuse of configuration common to multiple environments while making it easy to switch configuration for a specific environment.

## Activation

To use an environment, you can pass the option `--environment=<ENV>` to the CLI command, or set the `MELTANO_ENVIRONMENT=<ENV>` variable.

```shell
# Using the CLI option
meltano --environment=dev elt tap-github target-sqlite

# Using env vars
export MELTANO_ENVIRONMENT=dev
meltano elt tap-github target-sqlite
```

### Default Environments

If you have an environment that you'd like to use by default without having to pass the `--environment=<ENV>` option or set the `MELTANO_ENVIRONMENT=<ENV>` variable you can set it as the `default_environment` in your `meltano.yml`.

```yaml
default_environment: <ENV>
```

## Example

When activating an environment, you will observe different configurations are injected by Meltano
whenever you invoke an operation in the command line:

```console
$ meltano --environment=prod config target-snowflake
{
  "dbname": "prod",
  "warehouse": "prod_wh",
  "batch_size_rows": 100000
}
```

```console
$ meltano --environment=dev config target-snowflake
{
  "dbname": "dev",
  "warehouse": "dev_wh",
  "batch_size_rows": 1000
}
```

## Commands with support for `--environment`

See the [CLI Reference](/reference/command-line-interface#environment).
