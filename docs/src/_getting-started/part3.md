Let’s learn by example.

Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a end-to-end modern ELT stack.

In parts [1](/getting-started/part1) & [2](/getting-started/part2), we extracted data from GitHub and loaded it into a (local) PostgreSQL database. Now it is time to have more fun. We decide to load all attributes from the data we selected previously, and then build a model listing the different authors of commits to our repository.

That means, in this part we're going to unleash dbt [(data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/) onto our data to transform it into meaningful information. Don't worry, you don't need to know anything about dbt, this tutorial is self-contained. You do not need to install dbt yourself, it works as a Meltano plugin.

## Select more source data
To get all the data from the GitHub commits, you can use the `meltano select` command:

```bash
meltano select tap-github commits "*"
```

This will add the following line to your project file:
```yaml
      extractors:
      - name: tap-github
        select:
        - commits.url # <== technically not necessary anymore, but no need to delete
        - commits.sha # <== technically not necessary anymore, but no need to delete
        - commits.commit_timestamp # <== technically not necessary anymore, but no need to delete
        - commits.* # <== new data.
```

You can test that the new data is extracted by using `meltano invoke`:

<div class="termy">
```console
$ meltano invoke tap-github
2022-09-22T07:36:52.985090Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active

Next, we add the dbt plugin to transform this data.

## Install and configure the postgres specific dbt transformer
dbt uses different [adapters](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms) depending on the database/warehouse/platform you use. Meltano transformers match this pattern; in this case our transformer is `dbt-postgres`. As usual, you can use the `meltano add` command to add it to your project.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ meltano add transformer dbt-postgres

</div>

<br />
As you can see, this adds both the transformer as well as a [file bundle](/concepts/plugins#file-bundles) to your project. You can verify that this worked by viewing the newly populated directory `transform`.

## Configure dbt
Configure the dbt-postgres transformer to use the same configuration as our target-postgres loader using `meltano config`:

<div class="termy">
```console
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set host localhost
&ensp;&ensp;Transformer 'dbt-postgres' setting 'host' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'localhost'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set port 5432
&ensp;&ensp;Transformer 'dbt-postgres' setting 'port' was set in `meltano.yml`: 5432
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set user meltano
&ensp;&ensp;Transformer 'dbt-postgres' setting 'user' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'meltano'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set password password
&ensp;&ensp;Transformer 'dbt-postgres' setting 'password' was set in `.env`: 'password'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set dbname postgres
&ensp;&ensp;Transformer 'dbt-postgres' setting 'dbname' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'postgres'
$ meltano config dbt-postgres set schema analytics
&ensp;&ensp;Transformer 'dbt-postgres' setting 'schema' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'analytics'
```
</div>

## Add our source data to dbt
The EL pipeline run already added our source data into the schema `tap_github` as table `commits`. dbt will need to know where to locate this data. Let's add that to our dbt project:

```bash
mkdir transform/models/tap_github
```

Add a file called `source.yml` into this directory with the following content:

```yaml
config-version: 2
version: 2
sources:
  - name: tap_github     # the name we want to reference this source by
    schema: tap_github   # the schema the raw data was loaded into
    tables:
      - name: commits
```

Now we're able to reference the table using the keyword "source" as you can see next.

## Add a transformed model
Add a file called `authors.sql` to the folder `transform/models/tap_github` with the following contents:

```sql
{% raw %}
{{
  config(
    materialized='table'
  )
}}


with base as (select *
from {{ source('tap_github', 'commits') }}) {% endraw %}

select distinct (commit -> 'author' -> 'name') as authors from base
```

This model is configured to creating a table via the `materialized='table'` configuration. The keyword `source` is used in dbt to reference the source we just created. The actual model selects the distinct author names from the commits which are wrapped into a JSON blob.

## Run the transformation process
To create the actual table, we run the dbt model via `meltano invoke dbt-postgres:run`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ meltano invoke dbt-postgres:run
2022-09-22T12:30:31.842691Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
12:31:01  Running with dbt=1.1.2

12:31:02
12:31:03  Concurrency: 2 threads (target='dev')
12:31:03
12:31:03  1 of 1 START table model analytics.authors ..................................... [RUN]
---> 100%
12:31:03  1 of 1 OK created table model analytics.authors ................................ [SELECT 2 in 0.59s]
12:31:03
12:31:03  Finished running 1 table model in 1.56s.
12:31:03
12:31:03  Completed successfully
12:31:04
12:31:04  Done. PASS=1 WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
#
```

</div>

You can check the data inside the database using your favourite SQL editor. There should now be a table inside the `analytics` schema called `authors` populated with data.

## Run the complete pipeline

To check that everything works together as a pipeline, we clean out once more and run the whole ELT pipeline. Drop the tap_github.commits and the analytics.authors tables by running

```bash
docker exec meltano_postgres psql -U meltano -c 'DROP TABLE tap_github.commits; DROP TABLE analytics.authors;'
```

Run the final pipeline alltogether using the parameter `--full-refresh` to ignore the stored state:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ meltano run --full-refresh tap-github target-postgres dbt-postgres:run
[warning  ] Performing full refresh, ignoring state left behind by any previous runs.

</div>

There we have it, a complete ELT pipeline.
