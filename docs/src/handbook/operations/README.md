## Financial operations

Financial operations includes spending company money, guidelines, and the reimbursement policy. 

### Spending company money

We expect Meltano team members to take responsibility to determine what they need to purchase or expense in order to do their jobs effectively. We don't want you to have to wait with getting the items that you need to get your job done. You most likely know better than anyone else what the items are that you need to be successful in your job.

### Guidelines

1. Spend company money like it is your **own** money, but please make decisions with the company's best interest in mind.
1. You don't have to [ask permission](https://m.signalvnoise.com/if-you-ask-for-my-permission-you-wont-have-my-permission-9d8bb4f9c940) before making purchases **in the interest of the company**. When in doubt, do **inform** your manager prior to the purchase, or as soon as possible after the purchase.
1. It is generally easiest and fastest for you to make any purchases for office supplies yourself and expense them. If you are unable to pay for any supplies yourself, please reach out to your manager or the Operations Analyst to ask that they make the purchase on your behalf.
1. You may privately use Meltano property (e.g. MacBook), to check your private e-mails, or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm Meltano, or interfere with Intellectual Property. 
1. If you make a purchase that will cost Meltano $1000 USD per item (or over), this is classed as company property, you will be required to return the item(s) if you leave the company.
1. Any non-company expenses should not be paid with a company credit card.
1. If team members submit expenses for reimbursement for personal purchases that are not covered in the expense policy, this is a violation of our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics.

### Reimbursement policy

1. Purchases of at least $10 USD require a receipt.
1. Employees should file expense reports in the same month that the purchase was made. Contractors should include receipts with their invoices.
1. To be reimbursed for company expenses, please submit a report in [Expensify](/handbook/tech-stack/#expensify) (all team members). Non-US team members will also submit a report in Remote.

#### US team member reimbursement process

1. Upload receipts in Expensify and submit a report. Please use the appropriate tags/categories and include comments when appropriate. If a tag/category is missing, you may be asked to edit your report.
1. Team members in the US will be automatically reimbursed through Expensify after their report is "final approved." 

#### Non-US team member reimbursement process

Although non-US team members will not receive reimbursement through Expensify, the company needs to have a single source of truth for expenses. So, all team members will need to use Expensify. You'll then submit an additional report in Remote to receive reimbursement.

1. Upload receipts in Expensify and submit a report. Please use the appropriate tags/categories and include comments when appropriate. If a tag/category is missing, you may be asked to edit your report.
1. Once the Expensify report is approved, create an expense in [Remote](/handbook/tech-stack/#remote) referencing the Expensify report number and matching its full amount. 
1. The approved expense amount will be deposited in your account with your monthly salary.

### Office equipment and supplies

The company will reimburse for the following items if you **need it for work or use it mainly for business**, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring payroll taxes. Please keep in mind that while the amounts below are guidelines and not strict limits, any purchase (other than a laptop) that will cost Meltano $1000 USD per item (or over) will require prior approval from your manager.

The below averages are what Meltano **usually** reimburses. If you prefer to spend more on a given item, that's okay considering the average price. You are also welcome to expense the `Meltano Average Price in USD` portion, and cover the rest with personal funds. For example, if you purchase a high-end Steelcase ergonomic chair, you are welcome to expense the average price per the table below and cover the rest with personal funds. We are encouraging our members to use their best judgment when spending the company's money.

When reimbursing through Expensify please select "reimbursable" for the portion which Meltano will be covering, and add a note explaining the receipt difference.

Team members should not use a Corporate Credit Card to purchase office equipment for their personal workspace.  All office equipment purchases for a team member's personal workspace should be made on a personal credit card and expensed.

#### Setting up a home office for the first time?

Meltano team members are encouraged to create a comfortable, ergonomic workspace. Please do research to find a chair, desk, and other equipment that facilitate good posture and healthy habits.

#### Software

1. We do not issue Microsoft Office 365 licenses, as Meltano uses [Google Workspace](/handbook/tech-stack/#google-workspace)
   (Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc.) instead.

##### Individual subscriptions

Meltano does not reimburse individual software subscriptions (e.g. Apple Music, Krisp, etc.).

###### Subscription exceptions

Certain types of individual subscriptions are reimbursable, such as VPN service. If you are uncertain whether a particular service is reimbursable, please contact the Operations Analyst.

#### Hardware

It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Please use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask your teammates.

If you wish to go over the recommended reimbursement, this is an exception and should first be raised with your manager and if supported, should be raised with the Operations Analyst who will review and respond to the request.

The technology price guidelines are based on acquiring products in the United States. Meltano understands prices may vary based on location. If the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be within the above price guidance.  

## Tools and technology

### Tech stack

View the [complete list](/handbook/tech-stack) of our tech stack. 

### Laptop configurations

Meltano approves the use of Apple and Linux operating systems, Windows is prohibited. The prohibition on Microsoft Windows is for the following reasons:

- While there has been security issues with all operating systems, due to the popularity of the Windows operating system it is the main platform targeted by attackers with spyware, viruses, and ransomware.
- macOS is pre-loaded onto Apple hardware.
    Linux is free.
    To take advantage of the features in Windows as a business, Meltano would have to purchase Windows Pro licensing as these business features are not available on Windows Home Edition.
    As many purchases of laptops have occurred with employees making the purchases and then being reimbursed by Meltano, a remote employee would typically be making a purchase of a laptop pre-loaded with Windows Home Edition.
- Windows Home Edition is notoriously [hard to secure](https://www.markloveless.net/blog/2019/1/15/dealing-with-windows-10).

Apple hardware is the common choice for most Meltano team members, but if you are comfortable using and self-supporting yourself with Linux (Ubuntu usually) you may also choose from the Dell builds below.

#### Apple Hardware

We recommend either:

1. (MacBook Pro) - [16”  / 512gig SSD / 32gig RAM / i9 or i7 CPU](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-gray-2.6ghz-6-core-processor-512gb)

1. (MacBook Pro) - [13” / 512gig SSD / 16gigs RAM / i5 CPU](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch-space-gray-1.4ghz-quad-core-processor-with-turbo-boost-up-to-3.9ghz-256gb)

#### Linux hardware

Please only request a Linux laptop if you have experience with this operating system and its requirements, all others, select a MacBook.

We strongly encourage Macs, but we do allow Linux if you are capable of self-support and updates.

- For Engineers, Support Engineers, Data Analysts, Technical Marketing Managers, Product Designers, UX Managers, Product Managers, Technical Writers, Digital Production (Dell/Linux) - [16”  / 512gig SSD / 32gig RAM / i9 or i7 CPU ](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/precision-5540-mobile-workstation/spd/precision-15-5540-laptop/xctop554015us4?configurationid=01b3d81d-57ff-4f71-a79f-f6b81ab2a521)

- Everyone Else (Dell/Linux) - [13” / 256gig SSD / 16gigs RAM / Quad-Core i5 CPU](https://www.dell.com/ng/business/p/latitude-13-7300-laptop/pd)

\*\*NOTE: Max price: **the price of the equivalent [16” MacBook pro laptop](#apple-hardware)**. Please make sure you order this model minimum 14 days, based on your locality, prior to your desired date to receive.

For Linux laptops, our **standard laptop provider is Dell** which generally comes pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux,(to save money by not purchasing a Windows license). Dell in Australia and New Zealand are unable to currrently pre load with Ubuntu Linux, so staff will need to install Linux onto the devices once they've been received.

The reasons for using Dell for a Linux laptop are as follows:

- There are several manufacturers of laptop systems that offer Linux, but Dell is the only major manufacturer that has done so for years, and it has already worked out shipping issues for all of the countries where Meltano employees live.

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is the preferred platform due to both stability and an extremely fast patch cycle - important for security patches.

- There are opportunities for corporate discounts in the future if we can concentrate purchases from a single vendor.

- Dell is a [certified Ubuntu vendor](https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop/models?query=&category=Desktop&category=Laptop&level=&release=18.04+LTS&vendors=Dell) with plenty of laptop choices available. They even have their own Ubuntu OEM release of Ubuntu they maintain, and as a result of their effort, the standard Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image natively supports Dell hardware and even firmware updates.

- To date, all of Dell's security issues have involved their use of Windows, not their hardware.

### Calendars

Shared calendars and meetings:
- [Community Meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wMWNqNDhoYTRoMTk5Y3RqZWZpODV0OWRnY0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t): Meetings open to the community
  - [Office Hours](/handbook/engineering/#office-hours): Weekly on Wednesday, owned by AJ
  - [Demo Day](/handbook/engineering/#demo-day): Weekly on Friday, owned by Taylor
- Team Meetings: Meetings with the team

- External Meetings: Meetings with users and partners
- Time Off: All-day events for periods team members will not be working

## GitLab workflow best practices

We use [GitLab](/handbook/tech-stack/#gitlab) for project management across the organization. Whether you work in engineering or marketing, GitLab will be the central tool for collaboration and delivery. To ensure end-to-end visibility and asynchronous communication, we use epics, issues, and merge requests to organize our work. 

As you work within GitLab, please be sure to follow these best practices:

1. Directly mention (`@username`) the people you want to involve in a comment, especially the person you're replying to. Some people only work through GitLab todos (rather than email notifications), and therefore, they will only see responses to comments/threads if they're explicitly mentioned.
1. If an issue is blocked or waiting for someone's action, the issue should be assigned to those individuals.
1. Include all relevant information, including labels, milestones, due dates, and details. 
1. Provide updates in a comment to document progress. 

## Benefits and perks

* Unlimited PTO with minimums
* Professional development support and budget
* Reimbursable coworking fees and external office space
* Budget for office equipment and workspace supplies
* Team offsites
* Work with a global, distributed team
* Flexible working hours
* Access to world class founders, investors and mentors

### Flexible working hours

Because Meltano is a fully remote and distributed team, we don't have set working hours. Team members are encouraged to set their own work schedule, depending on their needs and working style. We understand that some people work best at certain times of the day, so please work when you're at your best. Also, if you need to take a break during the day, have a doctor's appointment, or need to pick up your kids, please feel empowered to readjust your schedule. Please note that there may be times when you'll need to adjust your schedule (e.g. a necessary synchronous meeting). 

#### Taking breaks during the day

Whether you go for a walk, take a nap, or watch your favorite show, you're enouraged to take breaks during the day. [Research](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190312-the-tiny-breaks-that-ease-your-body-and-reboot-your-brain) has found that taking breaks - even for a few minutes - improves productivity, creativity, and concentration. Don't ever feel guilty when you need time away from your computer. 

### Paid time off

Meltano has an unlimited time off policy, and we encourage team members to take the time they need to rest and recharge. 

We recommend every team member takes a minimum 30 days off a year, and we have recommended minimums for various life events, including:

* Minimum 15 days for compassionate leave 
* Minimum 15 days for victims of domestic violence
* Minimum 15 days for burnout

To log time off, team members should use [PTO by Roots](/handbook/tech-stack/#pto-by-roots) in Slack (under Apps).

### Visiting grant

**Note**: To keep team members and our communities safe, we've temporarily suspended the visiting grant until travel is less of a risk around the world. We'll provide updates to team members and will regularly review this policy over the course of the pandemic.

Meltano is an all-remote company with team members all over the world. If you want to visit other team members to get to know them, Meltano will assist with travel expenses (e.g. flights, trains, parking, car rental, and ground transportation to/from airport) for a total of up to $150 for every team member that you visit. Please note lodging is excluded. To be clearer, if you meet 2 team members during your visit, the maximum limit of your visiting grant could be $300 ($150*2). You don't need to work on the same project or team. We'd like you to get to know each other and your roles at Meltano, so we encourage you to discuss work for at least part of the time you're meeting.

Please note: The visiting grant applies to transportation costs and not other expenses related to travel (e.g. lodging, food). It may be acceptable to cover a meal, however, if the meeting is pre-announced to other people in the region to encourage as many of them to attend as possible.

To claim the grant, include a line item on your expense report or invoice along with the receipt of your flights, trains, and/or transportation to/from the airport with a list of the team members you visited. The expense report may be submitted during the first month of travel or up to 3 months after your trip has concluded. That said, if it's more frugal to book and expense your travel further in advance, please do so.

The visiting grant is inspired by Douwe's trip around the world during his time at GitLab. Douwe met [49 colleagues in 20 cities, in 14 countries, on five continents, in 6 months](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/01/31/around-the-world-in-6-releases/). 

#### Significant life event grant

Recognizing that team members may wish to share significant events in each other's lives, such as weddings or civil partnerships, Meltano will assist with travel expenses to attend these events. This grant works the same way as the, except the reimbursement limit is $300 per team member you visit at an event.

### Family and Friends Day

Inspired by GitLab's Family and Friends Day, Meltano has made Family and Friends Day a regular part of the culture. On these days, we will close the doors to the Meltano virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a publicly visible shutdown. Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it. If you are on call or need to work during the scheduled Friends and Family Day, please select another day that works best for your schedule.

#### Upcoming Family and Friends Days

* 2021-10-15
* 2021-11-24

These dates are tracked in the Team Meetings Calendar. 
Meltano team members should mark these days off using PTO by Roots.

In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Meltano team members to continue to take additional days off, as needed. 
Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.

## Business operations

### Calendar quarters

Use calendar quarters (e.g. 2021-Q4) rather than fiscal quarters (e.g. FY22-Q4) when discussing time.
