# Team Handbook

The Meltano team handbook is the central repository for how the team functions and builds the product.

As Meltano was incubated in [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and later [spun out](https://meltano.com/blog/2021/06/30/meltano-spins-out-of-gitlab-raises-seed-round),
many of our policies and processes are inspired by (if not outright copied from) theirs.
If a topic isn't covered here yet, the corresponding part of GitLab's handbook can generally be assumed to apply,
but we should explicitly move things over to our own handbook so that we can adapt things to be more appropriate for our size and unique culture.

## Communication

We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world, so it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently. We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, merge requests, and Slack channels. 

### Asynchronous communication

Asynchronous communication is the practice of communicating and moving projects forward without requiring stakeholders to be available at the same time. 

Asynchronous communication demonstrates consideration for team members across time zones and enables us to travel outside of our usual time zone or structure our day around commitments at home or in our community. We practice asynchronous communication by recording meetings, using GitLab Issues and Merge Requests rather than texts, calls, or Slack messages, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of conversations outside of the issue tracker (i.e. Slack and impromptu Zoom calls) are written down: If it's not in the issue, it didn't happen. All of these actions ensure that team members are not pressured to be online outside of their working hours. Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm. 

### In practice
 
1. Aim to respond to mentions other than FYIs within 3 business days. If you are unable to fulfill a specific request during that time, respond to the mention and indicate when you'll have an answer.
1. If you're behind on responding to notifications and expect to miss a deadline for any new mentions (until you're caught up), please inform the team in the Kickoff, and ask that urgent requests be sent to you via Slack DM and include the issue/MR link.
1. Use direct language when communicating. If you want someone to take action, directly tell them what's required, and when you need an answer, and whether there is urgency. Also indicate whether something is a "must have" or "nice to have" when asking for collaboration. 
1. Overcommunication can be appropriate. You can mention someone in an issue, but we all know that sometimes we can miss something, so if a request has stagnated, you can send someone a direct message as a gentle reminder. If you need something urgently, you can also send a Slack message to request that something is prioritized. 

#### Slack guidelines

1. **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless something is urgent and important.** 
1. Use `FYI @username` when you want someone to be aware of what's being discussed, but they're not required to take action.
1. Use `@username` when you want someone to take a specific action, such as contributing to the discussion or answering a question.
1. If decisions are made on Slack, please either paste a screenshot of the conversation in the relevant issue/MR or provide a summary of what was discussed.

#### Issue and merge request guidelines

1. Use `FYI @username` when you want someone to be aware of what's being discussed, but they're not required to take action.
1. Use `@username` when you want someone to take a specific action, such as contributing to the discussion or answering a question.
1. Directly mention (`@username`) the people you want to involve in a comment, especially the person you're replying to. Some people only work through GitLab TODOs (rather than email notifications) and will only see responses to comments and threads if they're explicitly mentioned.
1. Be mindful that most issues and MRs are public by default (unless the project is private or the issue confidential), and our communication in them can be viewed by our community. Please always consider how we present ourselves to the public.

#### Email guidelines

1. Email should only be used when communicating with external vendors or when discussing sensitive, confidential matters (e.g. PeopleOps or financial situations).
1. Write `FYI` when you want someone to be aware of what's being discussed, but they're not required to take action.

### Best practices

1. **Kindness matters.** Always communicate with kindness and empahty. Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.
1. **All written communication happens in English**, even when sent one on one, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.
1. **Own your actions**: If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
1. **You're not expected to be available all the time**. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
1. **Sometimes synchronous communication is the better option**, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked or when an asynchronous conversation isn't resolved after a few rounds of back-and-forth. 
1. **It's okay to ask as many questions as you have**. Please ask them so that team members can provide and view answers. Use issues or public chat channels instead of direct messages or emails.
1. **Make merge requests to update the handbook with answers** to questions you've received.
1. **Include links when you mention something** (e.g. a merge request, issue, commit, webpage, comment).
1. **All company data should be shareable by default**. Don't use a local text file, but rather leave comments on an issue.
1. **Provide due dates or communicate your progress on tasks**. Answers like: "will do," 
OK," "it is on my todo list" are not helpful. If it's a small request, it's better to spend 2 minutes to do the task to unblock someone. If it's a large request that requires a time investment, then communicate that to the other person so that they can either solve it in another way if your timeframe exceeds their needs.
1. **Avoid creating private groups** for internal discussions, unless a topic is confidential. We aim to be transparent, and private discussions are not searchable and easily documented.
1. **Use [low-context communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures)** by being explicit in your communications. We are a remote-only company, located all over the world. Provide as much context as possible to avoid confusion. Relatedly, we use [ubiquitous language](#ubiquitous-language) for communication efficiency.
1. **Be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals**. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.
1. **Focus on what we can directly influence.** There are many factors we can't directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things. 
1. **Always adhere to our Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct.**
1. **Express your thoughts.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
1. **Feedback is Essential.** It's difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members' countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.

### Everyone is a Moderator

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager or the Operations Analyst to discuss.

### Family and Friends Days

Inspired by GitLab's [Family and Friends Day](https://about.gitlab.com/company/family-and-friends-day/), Meltano has made Family and Friends Day a regular part of the culture. 
On these days, we will close the doors to the Meltano virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a publicly visible shutdown.

Team members can share about their Family and Friends Day in the #family-and-friends-day Slack channel after the event, or publicly on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever they're most comfortable using the hashtag #FamilyFriends1st. 
Sharing is optional. 
Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it.

#### Upcoming Family and Friends Days

* 2021-08-20 - The first Meltano Family & Friends Day
* 2021-09-17
* 2021-10-15
* 2021-11-24

These dates are tracked in the [Team Meetings Calendar](/handbook/#calendars). 
Meltano employees should mark these days off using [PTO by Roots](/handbook/tech-stack/#pto-by-roots).

In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Meltano Team Members to continue to take additional days off, as needed. 
Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.
