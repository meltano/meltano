# Team Handbook

The Meltano team handbook is the central repository for how the team functions and builds the product.

As Meltano was incubated in [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and later [spun out](https://meltano.com/blog/2021/06/30/meltano-spins-out-of-gitlab-raises-seed-round),
many of our policies and processes are inspired by (if not outright copied from) theirs.
If a topic isn't covered here yet, the corresponding part of GitLab's handbook can generally be assumed to apply,
but we should explicitly move things over to our own handbook so that we can adapt things to be more appropriate for our size and unique culture.

### Family and Friends Days

Inspired by GitLab's [Family and Friends Day](https://about.gitlab.com/company/family-and-friends-day/), Meltano has made Family and Friends Day a regular part of the culture. 
On these days, we will close the doors to the Meltano virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a publicly visible shutdown.

Team members can share about their Family and Friends Day in the #family-and-friends-day Slack channel after the event, or publicly on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever they're most comfortable using the hashtag #FamilyFriends1st. 
Sharing is optional. 
Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it.
Upcoming Family and Friends Days:

* 2021-08-20 - The first Meltano Family & Friends Day
* 2021-09-17
* 2021-10-15
* 2021-11-24

In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Meltano Team Members to continue to take additional days off, as needed. 
Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.
