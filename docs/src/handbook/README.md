# Team Handbook

The Meltano team handbook is the central repository for how the team functions and builds the product.

As Meltano is part of [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), those parts of the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) that are not specific to the GitLab product can be assumed to also apply to Meltano.

## Subresources

## Customer Support

### Email

Emails to `hello@meltano.com` forward to Zendesk so they can be triaged, assigned, and managed.
This email is not advertised anywhere (but here), but is used for all of our subscriptions.
Team members have their own accounts and master account login info can be found in 1Password.

#### Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

Emails to `security@meltano.com` also forward to Zendesk, and are automatically assigned to the Security group, which includes all current team members.
As documented in our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/docs/responsible-disclosure.md), we will acknowledge receipt of a vulnerability report the next business day and strive to send the reporter regular updates about our progress.

### Intercom Live Chat powered

The [Meltano.com website](https://www.meltano.com) is set up with live chat powered by Intercom.
