# Team Handbook

The Meltano team handbook is the central repository for how the team functions and builds the product.

As Meltano is part of [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), those parts of the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) that are not specific to the GitLab product can be assumed to also apply to Meltano.
