Tips and Tricks:
* Putting a title card on videos makes them easy for folks to find later on
* TikTok has automated closed captioning but it regularly messes up. We should review CC before putting the video live (important for accessibility)
* TikTok is notorious for shadow banning people for vague community guidelines violations, so let's make sure content has minimal swearing and nothing TikTok could consider dangerous 
* You can stream to TikTok and Twitch at the same time with some work- this is an easy way to invite guests ans the community to collaborate. Live streams can also get temporarily blocked on TikTok for vague violations, so let's make sure guests are aware of the rules too.

#### Slack <a name="slack"></a>

## Meltano Blog

Want to hear everything we are talking and thinking about internally and in the open source data would. Follow along, it's easy!

### Naming a Blog Post
Start with the title of the post, be as descriptive as possible but succinct. Do not begin with the date. Only include a date if the content will not be evergreen and it is critical to note the date for the timeliness of the post. Adding a date to the title will instantly date the post and generally when people are looking for content they are not looking for when it was published more what they can learn in the post. 

## YouTube

Meltano posts numerous videos to YouTube each week, covering everything from product releases to engineering discussions. Meltano videos posted to YouTube should follow a standard template when naming a video and adding a video description. Common naming conventions make it simple to find the latest version of our weekly videos, and an expanded description with information about Meltano and how to contact the team make it easy for individuals who discover a video to get up to speed quickly.

### Naming a YouTube Video

Videos uploaded to YouTube should have names that try and follow the same format wherever possible.

- They always start with “Meltano"
- They then describe the type of recording (Weekly Kickoff, Meeting, Speedrun, Release, Discussion, etc)
- If there’s a specific version of Meltano being referenced, (in a speedrun or release), reference it with a lower-case v followed by the release number (`v1.3.0`)
- Finish with the date in YYYY-MM-DD (`2019-11-01`)
- Separate all names with dashes

Examples of great YouTube video names include:

- Meltano Weekly Kickoff - 2019-10-31
- Meltano Release - v1.3.0 - 2019-10-31
- Meltano Meeting - Marketing Planning - 2019-10-31
- Meltano Discussion - Singer Tap Brainstorming - 2019-10-31

### Writing a YouTube Video Description

Video descriptions should have a short (can be one sentence or phrase) blurb at the beginning, followed by evergreen information about Meltano that can simply be copied and pasted.

Things to consider when writing a great, short, video description:
- Descriptions are short and to the point, explaining what the video is covering and optionally the teams participating (engineering, marketing, leadership, security, etc)
- Don’t worry about “how” something is being worked on, discussed, solved - that’s what the video is for! Description should cover “what, who, why"
- Great descriptions highlight key words/phrases, especially when discussing specific integrations (“we’re discussing how to fix a bug with our Google Analytics data tap”) or an external component (“our data source for XYZ has a new feature”)
- Timestamps can be linked to just by writing the timestamp: `1:33`.

Examples of a great YouTube video description include:

```md
Meltano v1.3.0 is publicly released, adding the ability to distill rocket fuel and manufacture widgets, with numerous bug fixes and improvements, including:
- bug fix #1
- improvement #1
- improvement #2
```

```md
The Meltano Engineering team discusses the importance of tabs vs spaces in minified CSS comments when optimizing for compiled code readability.
```

This full example of a Meltano YouTube video description includes evergreen content that should always be included:

```md
Meltano v1.3.0 is publicly released, adding the ability to distill rocket fuel and manufacture widgets, with numerous bug fixes and improvements, including:
- bug fix #1 (link)
- improvement #1 (link)
- improvement #2 (link)
