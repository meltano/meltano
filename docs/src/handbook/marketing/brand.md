## Meltano Brand Kit

### Brand Personality
Our personality is built around four main characteristics.

* **Human**: We write like we talk. We avoid buzzwords and jargon, and instead communicate simply, clearly, and honestly.
* **Competent**: We aim to be masterly at what we offer, and communicate with conviction.
* **Humble**: We care about helping those around us achieve great things more than we care about our personal accomplishments.
* **Inclusive**: We embrace new ideas, new voices and new perspectives. We are always happy to be educated.
* **Fun**: We like Shramp and other oddities. 

### Tone of Voice
Friendly, informative yet ambitious. We bring empathy to all interactions and stewardship to those new to the space. 

### Brand Resources
