# Developer Tools

Meltano is primarily offered to end-users as a hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution for busy non-technical business owners looking to gain insights into their business data. However, we are also [an open source project](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano), and you have the option to [self-host Meltano](/developer-tools/self-hosted-installation.html).
