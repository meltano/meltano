**FEES & PAYMENT TERMS**


    18. 
**Fees**.  Customer shall pay the applicable fees for use of the Meltano Cloud Service set forth in the applicable Service Order (the “**Fees**”).  Meltano reserves the right, at any time, to change, update, or modify Meltano’s pricing and/or payment terms (including, but not limited to, increasing fees).  For current pricing and additional fee terms, please see Meltano’s pricing page available at:  [https://docs.meltano.com/cloud/fees](https://docs.meltano.com/cloud/fees).


    19. 
**Payment Terms.**  Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Meltano all Fees are due and payable in advance, and will be billed to the credit card, or other payment method designated by Customer in the Service Order or otherwise specified in Customer’s Account (the “**Payment Method**”).  Our third-party payment services providers may charge additional fees for the use of their services to make payments hereunder, including fees in connection with cross-border monetary transactions.  Such additional fees will be subject to Customer’s review, including the time-period in which those fees will be charged, prior to order acceptance and submission.  Customer represents and warrants that it has the legal right and authority to use the Payment Method provided by Customer hereunder.  Customer hereby authorizes Meltano and its third party payment processors to bill and charge the Payment Method for the applicable fees due and payable by Customer hereunder and any applicable taxes and any other charges that Customer may incur in connection with the use of the Meltano Cloud Service, in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable.  If Customer provides a credit card as its Payment Method, Meltano may seek pre-authorization of the credit card account prior to the purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover Customer’s purchase.  To the extent that any amounts owed by Customer cannot be collected from or through the Payment Method(s), Customer is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.  If payment is not received or cannot be charged to Customer for any reason in advance, Meltano reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer’s and its Authorized User’s access to the Meltano Cloud Service and/or terminate this Agreement.  All fees are listed and payable in United States Dollars (USD).  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-RETURNABLE AND NON-CANCELLABLE.


    20. 
**Taxes**.  The fees are exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “**Taxes**”), and Customer is and shall be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on Meltano’s income), and any related penalties and interest, arising from the payment of the fees, the delivery of the Meltano Cloud Service (or any part thereof), or performance of any services by Meltano hereunder.  If Meltano is legally obligated or required to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this Section, Meltano will invoice Customer for, and Customer will pay, the amount of such Taxes, unless Customer provides Meltano with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.  Customer will also pay any additional Taxes as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by Meltano after all such Taxes are paid are equal to the amounts that Meltano would have been entitled to in accordance with this Agreement as if the Taxes did not exist.  Customer will provide, at Meltano’s request, proof of withholding tax remittance to the respective tax authority.


    21. 
**Trial and Promotional Offers**.  Meltano may make the Meltano Cloud Service available on a free trial basis or offer promotions (e.g., discounts, fee credits, etc.) for the Meltano Cloud Service.  If Customer obtains trial access or accepts any promotion offers for the Meltano Cloud Service, Customer acknowledges and agree that upon expiration of the trial and/or Customer’s use of the promotion, continued use of the Meltano Cloud Service shall be subject to Customer’s payment of the then-current Fees.  For the avoidance of doubt, and unless otherwise expressly authorized by Meltano in writing, if Customer terminates its Account prior to the end of a promotion period, or before using the entirety of the promotion, any unused promotions shall expire upon termination.

    26.

The party to be indemnified party shall (a) promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any claim asserted against the indemnified party, (b) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense thereof, and, (c) at the indemnifying party’s reasonable request and expense, cooperate and assist in such defense.  Under no circumstances shall the indemnifying party enter into any settlement that involves an admission of liability, negligence or other culpability of the indemnified party or requires the indemnified party to contribute to the settlement without the indemnified party’s prior written consent.  The indemnified party may participate and retain its own counsel at its own expense.
