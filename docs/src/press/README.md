### CEO Bio
Douwe Maan is the founder and CEO of Meltano, an open source data platform that enables collaboration, efficiency, and visibility.
Programming since age nine, Douwe has been leading software innovation throughout his career - from developing apps to building websites. A SaaS startup founded during his university days led him to join GitLab in 2015 as employee number 10 (after landing Sid Sijbrandij's, GitLab co-founder and CEO, parents as customers), and eventually becoming its first development lead and engineering manager.

In 2019, Douwe initially joined the internal Meltano project at GitLab as Engineering Lead to bring his experience building open source developer tools to the data space and was soon asked to become General Manager to focus on open source data integration.

In 2021, Douwe spun Meltano out of GitLab as an independent startup and raised $4.2M in Seed funding led by GV to bring the entire data lifecycle into the DataOps era.

Passionate about remote working, Douwe spent six months traveling the world, visiting and working with 49 colleagues in 14 countries on 5 continents. Douwe currently lives in Mexico City with his delightful wife, whom he met on his trip around the world, and their two cats.

### Head of Product & Data Bio
Taylor Murphy is the Head of Product and Data of Meltano, an open source data platform that enables collaboration, efficiency, and visibility.
Taylor has been deeply involved in leading and building data-informed teams his entire career. At Concert Genetics he scaled the Data Operations team to enable the management of hundreds of thousands of genetic tests and millions of claims records. 
At GitLab, he was the first data hire where he focused on building and scaling the data organization as the company headed towards its IPO.
He has been involved with Meltano since its inception, acting as the primary customer with whom the team engaged to understand the needs of modern data professionals. 

Taylor is passionate about maximizing the potential of data and building the future of the data profession. Outside of work, he loves spending time with his wife, two boys, and two dogs. 

He graduated from Vanderbilt with a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a BS in Chemical Engineering.
