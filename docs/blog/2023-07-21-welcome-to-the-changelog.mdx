Welcome to the new Meltano Changelog!

This is going to be our new place to share and keep a record of all of the product updates happening around the Meltano ecosystem. Previously we'd shared these in our newsletter and in Slack. We'll likely keep putting updates there, but this will be the primary destination for updates going forward.

Let's dive in to what's improved over the past month or so!

## ☁️ Meltano Cloud entered Public Beta

Right at the end of May this year we launched Meltano Cloud into Public Beta. This was a key milestone for us at it represented the threshold where early Alpha users were seeing enough value to pay for Cloud use. And it means we can start working through our large waitlist to onboard more users.

Since then we've:

- Added the ability to cancel a running job from the CLI
- Added syntax highlighting to the logs in the Cloud UI
- Added support for manual, once, and none aliases for schedules. Useful for one-off runs!
- Improved the error code response when creating or updating a deployment
- Squashed quite a few bugs. Thanks to our early users for all of their feedback!

## Connectors

We're continuing to invest in building first-party connectors based on the Meltano SDK.

- [Postgres Extractor](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-postgres)
- [Postgres Loader](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/target-postgres)
- [Universal File Extractor](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-universal-file)
- [Hubspot Extractor](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-hubspot)

We also have new extractors for Jira and Salesforce landing soon.

## SDK

We shipped 3 SDK releases

- [v0.28.0](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.28.0)
- [v0.29.0](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.29.0)
- [v0.30.0](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

Some highlights from these releases are:

- Supporting optional headers in OAuth requests
- Publishing the supported python version in `--about`
- Supporting union schemas which is useful for connectors that accept mutually exclusive settings (e.g. OAuth vs API key auth)
- Validation of a parsed/transformed record against the SCHEMA message
- Add Apache 2.0 as an optional license when developing a connector

And of course lots of fixes, under the hood changes, and improved documentation.
