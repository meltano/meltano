* [v0.47.0](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0)

Among other things, these releases shipped the following changes:

* [ACTIVATE_VERSION message support](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0) - Taps can now emit `ACTIVATE_VERSION` messages when the `emit_activate_version_messages` config is enabled, improving support for the Singer specification.
* [Global log level control](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0) - Setting `<APP_NAME>_LOGLEVEL` or `LOGLEVEL` environment variables now applies to all logs generated by taps, mappers, and targets.
* [Automatic post_process execution](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0) - The stream `post_process` method is now executed automatically for all stream types, simplifying custom stream implementations.
* [Enhanced metrics logging](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.0) - Exposed metric dictionary to make logging metrics as JSON easier for monitoring and observability.
* [Improved SQL target handling](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.0) - Better table name handling and support for continuing pagination after empty pages.
* [Enhanced data type support](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.0) - Proper encoding of `nan`, `inf`, and `-inf` values as `null` in Singer streams, and preserved microsecond precision in datetime comparisons.
