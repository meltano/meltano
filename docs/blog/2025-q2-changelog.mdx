## Meltano

We've released multiple versions of Meltano during Q2, from [3.7.2](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.7.2) through [3.7.9](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.7.9)!

These releases include, among other things, the following changes:

* [New unified `--state-strategy` CLI option](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9329) that provides clearer control over state handling in `run`, `el`, and `elt` commands, replacing the legacy `--merge-state` flag.
* [Plugin type inference for `meltano add`](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9317) - users no longer need to specify plugin types explicitly. Commands like `meltano add tap-github` now work automatically.
* [Automatic catalog refresh with `--full-refresh`](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9335) ensures data schema changes are properly detected when performing full refreshes.
* [Local timezone support in logging](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9328) - new `utc` parameter in logging formatters allows timestamps to be displayed in local time.
* [JSON output for `meltano select`](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9266) with the new `--json` flag provides machine-readable output for selection patterns.
* Fixed state merging for incomplete/interrupted payloads and improved compatibility with Click 8.2.x and Airflow 2.7.0+.
