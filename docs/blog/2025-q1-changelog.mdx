## Meltano

We've released versions [3.7.0](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.7.0) and [3.7.1](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.7.1) of Meltano!

These releases include, among other things, the following changes:

* [Custom state backends can now be created as plugins](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/8367), opening up possibilities for enterprise-grade state management solutions beyond the built-in options.
* [The UV virtual environment backend is no longer experimental](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/8991) and will become the default in a future release. Users can migrate now with `meltano config meltano set venv.backend uv`.
* [Improved logging capabilities](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/8975) including a new `--log-format` CLI option and automatic logging configuration for Singer-based plugins.
* The project environment variables are now [passed to the installation environment](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9158), improving plugin installation flexibility.
* [Switched from Poetry to UV](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/pull/9139) for faster dependency management and improved developer experience.
