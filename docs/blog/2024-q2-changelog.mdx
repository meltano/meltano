## Meltano

We've released version [3.4.0](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.4.0) of Meltano.

This release includes, among other things, the following changes:

* Support for [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage plugin installations. See how to enable it in the [Meltano documentation](https://docs.meltano.com/reference/settings/#venvbackend).
* Support installing multiple plugins of any type. This is a QOL improvement for users who want to install multiple plugins at once. See how to use it in the [Meltano documentation](https://docs.meltano.com/reference/command-line-interface#install).

A number of bug fixes and logging improvements were also made to the Meltano CLI.
