## Meltano

We've released Meltano [3.8](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.8.0) and [3.9](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v3.9.0).

These include improvements to the CLI:

- `meltano add`, `meltano install` and `meltano remove` no longer require specifying a plugin type.
- `meltano add` is now idempotent instead of failing if the plugin already exists.
- Run IDs now have time-ordered UUIDv7 values.

You can read the complete release notes [on GitHub](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/).
