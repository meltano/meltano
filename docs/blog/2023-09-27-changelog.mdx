## ‚òÅÔ∏è Meltano Cloud

### üèÉ Run State

With Meltano Core you're able to easily manage the state of your incremental runs using the `meltano state` command. Most of this functionality was ported to Meltano Cloud so that you can control your runs as you see fit. If you need to clear state to run a backfill, that's as easy as `meltano cloud state delete --state-id <id>`. Read more about the command in our [Cloud docs](https://docs.meltano.com/cloud/cloud-cli#state).
