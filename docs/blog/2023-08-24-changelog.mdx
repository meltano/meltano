The team has been heads down this month bringing improvements and squashing bugs to all things Meltano.
Let's take a look at some of the bigger items we shipped recently!

## ☁️ Meltano Cloud

### 🚀 Automated deployments

Now when you set your deployment to track a git branch, any new commits that appear on that branch will automatically be deployed in Meltano Cloud.
Previously users had to complete an additional manual step to get any new committed changes deployed.

Static deployments are still possible by referencing a particular git hash.

### 🚨 Custom Notifications

Cloud customers now have greater flexibility over their notifications.
With the updated [`config` CLI command](https://docs.meltano.com/cloud/cloud-cli#notification), you can specify exactly how you want to receive notifications.
Email and webhooks are the initially supported destinations and the payload of the notification can be filtered to exactly how you want it - failures only, successes only, or anything!

```bash
meltano cloud config notification set
```

### ➕ Add new projects from the CLI

New projects can now easily be [added from the CLI](https://docs.meltano.com/cloud/cloud-cli#project) to your Meltano Cloud account.
This simplifies onboarding for new users as well as our power users that have 10s or 100s of projects they need to onboard.


## Meltano Core

[v2.20.0](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/releases/tag/v2.20.0) of Meltano Core was released. This was mostly a bug, performance, and doc update release.

## MeltanoHub

We added a "Most Popular" listing to the Extractors page. [Check it out](https://hub.meltano.com/extractors)!

The Meltano Team and Community have also been busy adding new connectors and utilities to the Hub.
Many of the new connectors are related to our recent blog post about how [LLMs are mostly data pipelines](https://meltano.com/blog/llm-apps-are-mostly-data-pipelines/).

### Extractors
