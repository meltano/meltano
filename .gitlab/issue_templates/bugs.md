Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the "regression" or "bug" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.

If you are submitting an issue with a tap, please include:

- account details
- target details
- entities selected  with meltano select (if you have selected any entities), as the bug may be related to a specific entity
- the full elt command you are running
- full output of the meltano elt command. Logs can get pretty long, so you can add the full log as a snippet in the Meltano project and add a link in the issue.
