# NOTE: We do not use `Project(...).meltano.canonical` for 3 reasons:
# - It will make it difficult to refactor the rest of the Meltano core to be
#   based on the manifest if the manifest itself depends on the rest of Meltano
#   core.
# - The canonical representation has changes to the file that we don't want,
#   e.g. turning strings into datetime objects.
# - The canonical representation uses Ruamel, which is known to have poor
#   performance in some cases. No need to eat that cost here, since we don't
#   care about comment preservation in the manifest.
