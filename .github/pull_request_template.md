<!--

Please, go through these steps when you submit a PR.

1. Make sure your branch is not protected. In particular, avoid making PRs from the `main` branch of your fork.

2. Give a descriptive title to your PR. We use semantic titles, and the accepted types and scopes are listed in https://github.com/meltano/meltano/blob/main/.github/semantic.yml.

   A good title should look like this:

   ```
   feat(cli): The `meltano run` command now accepts a `--timeout` option to limit the time it runs
   ```

3. Provide a description of your changes.

4. Put "Closes #XXXX" in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).
