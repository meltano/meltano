# Meltano: Open source data integration

[Meltano](https://meltano.com) is an open source platform for building, running & orchestrating [Singer](https://www.singer.io/)-based ELT pipelines, that you can [run locally or host on any cloud](https://meltano.com/developer-tools/self-hosted-installation.html).

Use existing Singer [taps](https://meltano.com/plugins/extractors/) and [targets](https://meltano.com/plugins/loaders/) or [easily write your own](https://meltano.com/tutorials/create-a-custom-extractor.html) to extract data from any SaaS tool or database and load it into any data warehouse.
