Meltano
-------

Welcome to your Open Source DataOps Infrastructure to manage and centralize all the data tools in your stack and turn them into your ideal end-to-end data platform. With Meltano, you'll be able to collaboratively build and improve your data platform like a software project; spinning up a service or tool (Airflow, dbt, Great Expectations, Snowflake, etc) and easily configuring, deploying and managing it through a single control plane.
